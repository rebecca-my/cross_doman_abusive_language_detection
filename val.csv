This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other.

"Up till now , I hadnt heard about any GM products that concerned me about their safety. A few transplanted genes arent going make a tomato feel pain or let you squeeze blood from a turnip. The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product , like cotton , would turn into an insect-resistant , herbicide-resistant , uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae , so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae , and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae , what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild ? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ ( the water flea ) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff ( like fish ) eat the mosquito larvae , the _Daphnia_ , etc. If this organism gets out of control , it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon , I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle , because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels , like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment , which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible .

"I do not believe that God can be detected , observed or analyzed at this time , nor do I believe that at this time science can disprove his ( its ) existence. The problem with religions is that they project human aspects on to the divine entity. It is a concoction of insanity , hallucination , hypocrisy and fear. Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin , torturing , crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making "" GOD "" a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but "" God "" stays silent , blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does , Pops up the GOD for challenge , male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So , as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time , is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So , such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings. We are the Gods that we describe and we do exist , hence the conflict is only conceptual. That is why the debate never ends while you argue with those drunk with the above described concoction.

"Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. The argument he is offering is that if you have deflation , then currency becomes an interest bearing asset , since its real value is going up. This is the source of the so-called "" liquidity trap. "" If the deflation rate becomes high enough , the nominal interest rate should become negative ( because the dollars borrowers pay back are increasing in value faster than the real interest rate borrowers are willing to pay ) , so nobody investsthey just accumulate cash instead. In your answer , you have just reinvented one of the responses offered to this argument at the timethe real balances effect. As , in such a scenario , prices plunge down , all those people holding all that cash are getting an implicit income in the increasing value of their cashsome of which they will spend. I am not aware of any evidence that the phenomenon in question ever actually happened. As best I recall , the reason people paid attention to the theoretical idea was the mistaken belief that the Great Depression started and continued in spite of inflationary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. If that had been true , it would have raised the question of why the increased amount of money didnt start prices back up , as neoclassical monetary theory implied it should. Hence the metaphor that using monetary policy to expand was like pushing on a string. In fact , as we know know , the Feds actual policy was deflationaryas best I recall , the drop in the money supply from about 1929 to 1931 ( this isnt my field , and I am working from memory , so dont guarantee exact dates and numbers ) was several times larger than the largest previous percentage drop in the history of the U.S. For details , see _A Monetary History of the U.S._ by Friedman and Schwartz ( a different Friedman ) , or _The Great Contraction_ , which is the chapter on the Great Depression from that book , published separately.

"David , Do you know of any FAQ that would allow a Linux newbie like me to setup sendmail for mail relaying from a DMZ as you described ? Right now I am thinking of installing a SonicWall/DMZ and need to make a decision on whether I should let SMTP trough the FW to my Exchange server ( dont like the thought ) or using relay , but dont want to put a NT box into my DMZ just for relaying when a linux box does the same better and cheaper. I have some experience with setting up Linux as a DNS and web server in a lab environment , but sendmail makes me shiver . Thanks , Daniel Sidler to reply via e-mail , remove xxxs from address. Say no to spam. Gregg , With sonicwall/10 ( w/o DMZ ) I think you can just open one port ( SMTP ) to the mail server through the firewall. This does allow anyone to exploit any hole they find in the MS Exchange IMC , but the rest of the services on the exchange machine should be blocked. Personally , what I do is run use a dual homed web server ( IIS4 ) which is connected outside the firewall ( and has nothing useful on it ) to relay mail. IIS4 includes a very limited SMTP mail server service which I have set up to relay mail to our domain ( it will not relay any other domains ) . Our DNS MX entry points to the relay machine. Since all mail is immediately relayed to the exchange server , the relay machine never has any mail ( other than a small queue ) on it and it has no user accounts on it. You may want to put together a cheap linux or Windows system that relays mail from outside the firewall to accept/send mail. There appear to be plenty of free/cheap SMTP mail servers available. That way if it becomes compromised there is not much there worthwhile. includes a built in email proxy that does this ( but it is more expensive than sonicwall and you have to supply the hardware ) . David Abrams We have a single NT4 ( SP5 ) LAN server running file&print , Exch 5.5 sp2 ( uses ETRN on IMC to retrieve from ISP - works great ) , IIS4 ( intranet only ) using Wingate 3.0.5 and 56k modem as DOD router/firewall. We are now moving to DSL and therefor needing a real firewall solution. We have MSProxy v2 license available and are considering using SonicWall-10 also. ( Stateful inspection & proxy cache ? ) . 1 - Is this a recommended solution ? 2 - How are we best to connect the Exchange server without putting it outside the firewall ( DMZ ) ? Is this possible ?

"Some time ago I read an article on EDN by Bob Pease , who suggested using the CD4007 CMOS inverter pairs in an analog way. In this article was also shown the I-V characteristic of such MOS for low currents , but the graph wasnt really precise ( and , after all , I lost this article ) . Could anyone give me an hint or sends me information about using CD4007 in this way ? I always accept hints on methods for getting a precise CD4007 V-I curve for low currents. Why not measure it yourself , it doesnt take that long. You might be interested that the unbuffered version of the 4049 can be used as a MOSFET as well. Regards Rob

"I once made the mistake of loading Afterdark onto my windows 95 computer. I have deleted every Afterdark file I can find , but lurking somewhere in the entrails are instructions to the system about all the afterdark files that are no longer on my system. I have scoured win.ini , autoexec.bat , config.sys , etc. FirstAid 95 , for example , identifies the 100 or so disconnected afterdark files that I dont have. How do I get rid of every last vestige of this dark menace ? If you removed the program manually , instead of using Control Panel | Add/Remove Programs or Afterdarks own uninstall program ( if it has one ) , you will find debris scattered around the system. I would try installing it again and uninstalling it in one of those ways. Best Wishes , Steve Winograd

"Van Johnson was a guest on LETTERMAN about 10 years ago or so. He was a real jerk , and he and Letterman really got into it on the air. OK,I will bite : what happened ? Johnson was in the Broadway version of "" La Cage Aux Folles "" and came on Letterman to plug it. He was generally nasty ; I remember him complaining that the band was too loud , so Paul played more quietly and Johnson still moaned and covered his ears as they went to commercial. While I dont watch Letterman anymore , I still base my opinion of certain celebrities on their performances on that show. The three that stick out the most are : 1. Ricardo Montalban is very gracious and engaging. 2. Crispin Glover is legally insane. 3. Van Johnson is a snotty creep. Until further evidence is reported , MattH Thanks for the info.I used to watch Letterman a long time ago but grew a bit tired of some of his childish comments.But I do recall one particular show wherin he had John Phillips ( of the Mamas and Papas fame ) on as a guest.He was promoting ( ironically it turned out ) his new book about his life and the many drug-induced problems he had gone through,which supposedly now were in the past. Phillips was high as a kite ( to put it mildly ) and Letterman ( who was quite visible angry when he realized after he began talking with Philips that he was trashed ) and the audience knew it.It was so bad that Paul Schaeffer had to leave his position in the band and come over to sit next to Phillips to ensure there wasnt a physical confrontation between him and Letterman. Phillips came across ( stoned or not ) as a complete jerk and I often wondered why the network or Lettermans people didnt edit out that part of the show. Best Wishes , Steven Celli

"Maybe we have a different perception about the meaning of PUBLIC and PRIVATE in the first place. I suspect so. As I knew it , privacy is designed to prevent inadvertent human errors by segregating pieces from one another. A compiler doesnt have to respect this. Having a compiler really only be able to see public parts means that no information beyond the language level can be transmitted-what if the compiler , e.g. wanted to have a way to designate whether or not it figured out that certain functions were side-effect free ? Whether they could use some special calling convention ? Concepts which are not necessarily part of the Fortran language itself ? Personally , I think the notion that a compiler can or ought to only see one source file of the program at a time is the anachronism. Matthew B.

"Theory of Evolution works as follows : Even Christians acknowlege micro-evolution.the tendancy for creatures to adapt to their environment through changes in the gene pool. They deny MACRO evolution , that is , one species change to the next. Most of this is a failure to understand what macro-evolution is. One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was "" The Theory that man decended from apes. "" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree , not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99 % of their genetic code. Before there were men , or women , or apes , there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years , they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains , and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair , gained inteligence , and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically , macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution , as if it were forbidden by their god or something. Could it be that the christian god is influencing evolution to create creatures in his favor ? Frank Bartunek
