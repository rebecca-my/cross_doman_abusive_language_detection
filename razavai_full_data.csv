"It sounds as though you are arguing that the supply is very inelastic wrt price. Why would you expect that to be true ? Gold mining is a very expensive operation , and how deep it is worth going , how low a grade of ore it is worth processing , etc. depend on the price. Because almost all the gold dug up the past 5000 years is still above ground and part of the current "" supply "" . The amount of new gold mined every year barely increases the total. The size of the world economy has something like doubled in the past decade or two. But the gold amount in circulation hasnt. But if the econonmy grows faster than the amount of money in circulation , you get deflation. And contrary to what monetarists and gold bugs say , deflation is bad. 5 % inflation are a nuisance , but 5 % deflation means that the economy is in deep shit. Run that by me again. If suddenly everybody is rich , this is a bad thing ? Okay , granted , it cant last , but in the meantime it is all good. So please tell me why deflation is a bad thing. Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. Your argument against deflation is that "" it leads to money hoarding. "" This is patently untrue , thus your argument has no base. Unless I am missing something. ?

"[ snip ] Luckily for us in the FreeBSD camp , though , it is not as popular as Linux. That sort of makes FBSD immune to Microsofts FUD campaign , which is aimed squarely at Linux because of its popularity. Linux is taking the heat of the MS vs. Free Software competition. For example , when has MS ever complained about FBSD taking over their "" territory "" ? You also never hear about MS releasing documents claiming Windows NT is better than FreeBSD. Here , Linux has the misfortune of bearing the "" cross "" of the free software movement. Very WELL put. Like I said before , I am not saying that people running one Free Unix should like ALL Free Unices equally just because they are running Linux , FreeBSD , etc. in fact , it is perfectly healthy to think FreeBSD sucks and Linux rules. A person cant run them both. it is OK to have preferences. ( Over in comp.unix.bsd.freebsd.misc , there is a lot of flaming going on over which is better , easier to install , easier to use , etc. ) But I think that FreeBSD is a benefit to Linux , and vice versa. For example , FreeBSD would never have had the massive amount of free software ( such as xemacs , WindowMaker , gcc , to name a few ) if it werent for the demand for this software created by people running Linux to begin with. OTOH , having BSD in addition to Linux might create just enough of a free UNIX user base that companies would decide to port their software to Linux. Most of the time , Linux software will run on FreeBSD nearly as fast as it will on Linux. In fact , I am running the Linux version of NS Communicator 4.7 on FreeBSD ( check the header. it says Linux. ) So , all companies have to do is distribute Linux binaries of their software , and they will run on FreeBSD. In fact , I believe Linux at one time had the limited capability to run FreeBSD binaries , and that this emulation is currently broken. I dont really see the need for Linux to have BSD emulation , though , because it is so much more popular than BSD. FWIW , our local Linux users group has 2 FreeBSD users which are more than welcome. The wheel is turning but the hamster is dead .

"1 ) Download 2 ) Run/install SWGameEN.exe ( version 3.02 ) 3 ) Then copy SW3dpro.vxd to the windows system dir. Then the OS will see the game controller ! Hope this helps ! P.S. Microsoft committed a large gaffe by not including this vxd file with Win98SE. Chuck , I am waiting for my mx-300 to show-up ( ordered it , it will be here Monday I guess ) , but decided to try the drivers you mentioned above. At the moment , I am using the SB16 joystick port , which works with all joystick gear. Joystick resources are 0201-0201 , no conflicts. The link you offered above ( thanks , hell if I could find it ) , swgameen.exe is version 3.00 , not 3.02. Dunno if that matters much. Also , the sw3dpro.vxd is version 3.00 ( not 3.01 ) . After installing swgameen.exe , my dang rudders -refused- to calibrate. Got rid of the joystick update software ( restored from a backup ) , and all is fine again. Then I got to wondering ; hmm , for all my joystick-gear , I use Microsofts generic "" Gameport Joystick "" driver ( it is listed in System-Resources , also shows-up in the joystick-calibration screen ( in joystick-calibration , there is no other driver option ) . Since you mentioned this sw3pro.vxd , I am wondering if I should "" remove "" the generic Gameport-Joystick , and "" add "" and try this sw3pro.vxd driver ( ? ) . If so , what is the correct Joystick-name ( actually a driver ) to add ? In "" add new hardware "" , after installing the update file above , there are many Microsoft Sidewinder-Pro drivers to choose from. Did I miss a step ? Should I have tried a certain Microsoft JS driver ( other than "" Gameport Joystick "" ) ? Got ta laugh ; this joystick update "" leans "" ( heavily ) on setting up Microsoft joystick/pedals/etc. Adds 17mb to the hard-disk too. It would seem MS would make a "" generic "" joystick update. Otoh. I never installed MSs service pack 2.5 ( for OSR2 ) , as it insists- on installing IE-5 ( which is also a -very- large , proprietary browser ) . Nice update , but I use Netscape.

They usually find her music to be talentless or obnoxious and they perceive her as having been a destructive influence on something they loved , the Beatles. it is interesting to note that , throughout this debate , no one has offered any other rational explanation besides sexism and racism to explain why some people harbor so strong a dislike of Yoko Ono that they will point to her personally , as opposed to Johns love for her , as a contributing factor in the breakup of the Beatles. All kidding about digestive biscuits aside , read Get Back the Unauthorized Chronicle of the Beatles Let It Be Disaster for an authoritative account of problems Yokos behavior caused with the inner-workings of the Beatles. To me , there is no other rational explanation why one would choose to "" dislike "" someone one has never met and "" known "" only through the distorted fun-house mirror of "" the media "" and "" the devils radio.

I recently upgraded my computer system from an old P90 system to a 350 PII one by moving the hard-drives ( a 2 gig and a 1 gig ) and other useful cards from the old box to the new box. No problems there. OS/2 handled it beautifully. However. Now the computer store has convinced me that I should turn the old P90 box into a Linux box , and sold me the required hardware which included an 8 gig Harddrive ( Smallest one they had on the shelves ! By the way did you see that IBM is now selling a 73 ! Gig HD ? ? ) . I am using Warp 4 FP11. Of course before I install Linux I need to install OS/2. ( I am a Linux idiot , so I want something familiar to fall back on ) . Problems now. 1 ) The Bios wont auto detect past 2 gigs. It has 3 settings for a 2 gig HD ( normal , Large , LBA ) , if I can partition the HD to an intial 2 gig size , can I use the Bios anyway ? It is an old ( 1995 ) Award Bios. I have updated the OS/2 Install diskettes with the FDISK and IBM1S506.ADD on my boot partition. I am hoping that if I can install OS/2 in the first 1024 cylinders that it will look beyond the 2 gigs that the BIOS is limited to. Is this right ? My thinking is that if I can get BootManager and/or LILO to install in the first part of the HD then I can install Data and Swap partitions in the other part. Anything else I need to do or watch out for ? Is there a central repository for BIOS updates if I cant find my Mother Boards manufacturer ?

Johnson was in the Broadway version of "" La Cage Aux Folles "" and came on Letterman to plug it. He was generally nasty ; I remember him complaining that the band was too loud , so Paul played more quietly and Johnson still moaned and covered his ears as they went to commercial. While I dont watch Letterman anymore , I still base my opinion of certain celebrities on their performances on that show. The three that stick out the most are : 1.

"here is my five cents : 1 ) Linux is free , as are all of its applications. if you want to learn c , you can customize it to your hearts content. the only thing you pay for in Linux is the nice packaging and support. it is entirely legal to copy someone elses disk. you can run a program called star office , which is an MS clone , and is compatible with MS office documents. also free. nt and win2k are freaking expensive , the full version of ntw4 is at least 200 bucks ( Canadian ) . 2 ) the driver support for Linux is not complete. of course it is also not complete for nt or win2k , but is better for nt at least. check the hardware compatibility lists for each os and your hardware. win98 probably has the best hardware compatibility , although nt isnt bad if you dont want to worry about having certified drivers. 3 ) the application support is best on win98 , as it will play the most games , and 16 bit apps. most games will not play on nt , or if they do , will play much better on 98 due to better directx support. 4 ) win98 crashes like a Hungarian bus on the Italian alps in February. nt is very stable if you have certified hardware and drivers , and dont fuck around with it regularly like I do. I have heard Linux is incredibly stable. read an article about a guy that has run it for over 2 years without a stall. 5 ) win98 sets up like a pair of silk panties. very smooth. nt isnt bad either , but takes a bit of tweaking. I had to manually install my sound and video drivers , and the plug n play service. I heard BeOS has the best set-up program. 6 ) personally , I have a dual boot system , with win98 for games , nt for real work. since I am not in a mission critical enterprise , I will probably upgrade to win2k as soon as the final release comes out. I say this because of that old rule if it aunt broke dont fix it , and upgrading to win2k from an operating nt4 system would be foolhardy in a mission critical enterprise. unless the risks of a more user friendly os outweigh the risks of using a new , less-extensively tested one .

"By the way , what does Ilinden mean ? I suppose it has to do with prophet Ilias. Lucky the Slavs to be benefacted by the Greeks , as it concerns the religion. Dear Michael , Ilinden is just that , Saint Ilija day. But Ilija was an Old Testament Prophet , not a Greek ! He belongs to all Orthodox. Macedonia has early Christian churches , just like Greece. So the only benefactor everyone should thank is Christ Himself ! and the Holy Apostles , not some nation. There is a common Christian heritage. Michael Stavropoulos Subject : Re : Who are the Ftcogians The Greeks are humiliating themselves all over the world. There are Greek organizations that visit sick people in hospitals. They think that anyone with a Greek last name is automatically Greek. But this is not true because the Greek government changed the names of the Macedonians living in Aegean Macedonia into Greek in 1926. That is why it was embarassing for the Greeks when they came to visit my aunt in the hospital. She does not speak Greek but her name was changed into Greek against her will. Ilinden Where did they meet your aunt ? In a hospital or . ? Does she have a name or she is no-name as your irrefurable evidence ? Are you brain-damaged or not ? Are you taking drugs or not ? Are you racist or not ? Have you realised that you talk the same language with all the Slavs or not ? Some questions you have to answer to yourself first ! lol oh man !

"Gosh , Pierre , I dunno. Trevor Hemsley is an absolute expert in this area. I just finished several hours with a Warp City member who is finally back online. He had upgraded to FP12 without a problem then tried the beta release of SDD and it it screwed up video. He didnt want to but had no other recourse but to reinstall OS/2 from scratch. Once reinstalled he tried upgrading to FP12 and hit a trap error and the system would not go on any further. He couldnt back out the FP12 so he reinstalled again and posted in the setup newsgroup. There Trevor advised he rem out the sound card statement and try again. By then he had contacted me and I advised he upgrade the sound card driver before upgrading to FP12 again. He did that then tried FP12 and it worked. Before starting that RSU IBM should offer a small Uninstall program for download just in case. The WC member was so frustrated he was ready to throw in the OS/2 towel. Trevor is here : Now this is neat. First starting of ( and fully justified that is ) telling someone Trevor is the real expert. Then telling that you have wor- ked with an WC-member for hours. Trevor did advise him , but your advise was something else , yours was followed and voila it worked. Neatly implying that Trevor was wrong without proving it , because his advice might have worked also. BTW therre is some info on soundcards and FP12 in the readme. As well as for Pierre about IBMDASD not to be used from the fixpack if asked. But that is not the point I am writing this.

"No , one also needs to know what a "" coaxial balance wheel "" is , and a bit about the role it plays in the pocket watch in question. Actually , that was my screw up. I should have written that the balance wheel is positioned coaxial with the axis of the watch , as I found state in the original text when I got around to looking it up. ( The balance wheel itself is a type of torsion pendulum , the same thingies that played such a major role in the solution of the longitude problem in global navigation. ) That refers to a spring and rotating mass that takes the place of a pendulum. It rotates back and forth as a simple harmonic oscillator , and near the end of each "" swing "" knocks a pawl out of the tooth on a ratchet , and knocks another pawl into place so the ratchet can turn by one click. The rate that the clock moves is pretty much equal to the period of the balance wheel. Think you can do the problem now ? Hmm. First of all , I never learned what a "" pawl "" is - it is one of those words like "" gimbal "" and "" sprocket "" that for some weird reason people always say right before I tune out and stop paying attention. For some people , mathematics jargon has this effect - for me , it is gadget jargon. So all I know about "" pawls "" is what you just told me.

He was generally nasty ; I remember him complaining that the band was too loud , so Paul played more quietly and Johnson still moaned and covered his ears as they went to commercial. While I dont watch Letterman anymore , I still base my opinion of certain celebrities on their performances on that show. The three that stick out the most are : 1. Ricardo Montalban is very gracious and engaging. 2. Crispin Glover is legally insane. 3. Van Johnson is a snotty creep. Until further evidence is reported , MattH Thanks for the info.I used to watch Letterman a long time ago but grew a bit tired of some of his childish comments.But I do recall one particular show wherin he had John Phillips ( of the Mamas and Papas fame ) on as a guest.He was promoting ( ironically it turned out ) his new book about his life and the many drug-induced problems he had gone through,which supposedly now were in the past. Phillips was high as a kite ( to put it mildly ) and Letterman ( who was quite visible angry when he realized after he began talking with Philips that he was trashed ) and the audience knew it.It was so bad that Paul Schaeffer had to leave his position in the band and come over to sit next to Phillips to ensure there wasnt a physical confrontation between him and Letterman. Phillips came across ( stoned or not ) as a complete jerk and I often wondered why the network or Lettermans people didnt edit out that part of the show. Best Wishes , Steven Celli

"Er , you are using a Japanese rank - 10th dan. Call him a violet sash or something. Nah- the roundeyed sinowannabees have to accept that right along with using their pajama pattern , any variation on their ranking system , their concept of lineage and authority , lots of their words , lots of their religious and philosophical concepts and the rest of the sinophilic stuff , will come using their valued ritual words and honors right along with it. It is about like the old belt washing story- just another mythos for salesmanship. First they had one belt , then they had three , three became twenty , twenty became a hundred. Now , who has any idea what a particular piece of cloth is worth that isnt issued by their own club. The utter plethora of belts , sashes , colors , stripes , bars , bells , flowers , kanji , badges , patches , pins , tattoos , commemorative knives , pajama trim , medallions , bracelets , secret decoder rings and funny hats is beyond any codification at all. It is best just to realize how hard your honors are to achieve and be satisfied with it. It is nothing to me that someone has a 5th dan black unless he tells me who from. There are just too many of them floating around from Franks Karate Shop and Stormdoor Factory , Inc. 10th Dan claims are only more pretentious by definition. Chas

"Using the RSU methid , the installation of IBMs latest FixPack release ( FP12 ) was a piece of cake this morning. Here it has turned into a nightmare. I got increasingly bizarre error messages and the system is now totally wedged. HOW DO I BACK OUT of a fixpack from the text-mode command line accessible early at boot time ? The system wont go any further. More detailed history and symptoms : The system started at FP11 and has a new CDRW ( SCSI ) that replaces a CDROM ( IDE ) , but that configuration was working for 2 days prior to FP12. The RSU installation went as far as the reboot. First problem was that it announced that device VCSHDD.SYS was bad. Pressing "" enter "" lets the process continue , and all the other device drivers load , but then the system comes to a crashing halt ( C-A-D does not work ) with the message that : "" The file PMMERGE-PMVIOP.122 specified in the PROTSHELL statement on line 2 of the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a valid program. Line 2 is ignored. System stopped.

He had upgraded to FP12 without a problem then tried the beta release of SDD and it it screwed up video. He didnt want to but had no other recourse but to reinstall OS/2 from scratch. Once reinstalled he tried upgrading to FP12 and hit a trap error and the system would not go on any further. He couldnt back out the FP12 so he reinstalled again and posted in the setup newsgroup. There Trevor advised he rem out the sound card statement and try again. By then he had contacted me and I advised he upgrade the sound card driver before upgrading to FP12 again. He did that then tried FP12 and it worked. Before starting that RSU IBM should offer a small Uninstall program for download just in case.

The problem with religions is that they project human aspects on to the divine entity. It is a concoction of insanity , hallucination , hypocrisy and fear. Getting even with divinity for the alleged creation and bringing us into a torturous life. Thusly putting divinity in the lap of a virgin , torturing , crucifying and killing then resurrecting and asking for salvation. Sexual frustration as well is deeply rooted in religions. Making "" GOD "" a male entity is sexual projection from both sexes not from males only. Eve eats from the forbidden tree but "" God "" stays silent , blind and deaf. Yet when she gives Adam to eat and he does , Pops up the GOD for challenge , male to male. Adam defied Gods will. So , as far as proving the fallacy of religions at any time , is very easy. You are skeptic about disproving the fact of divinity in the primordial sense. Here I have to agree because the basis of consciousness and self awareness of life must have its roots in the primordial fabric from which we are made into the zenith of complexity. So , such a divinity is inseparable from beingness but does not interfere like complex beings except through complex beings. We are the Gods that we describe and we do exist , hence the conflict is only conceptual. That is why the debate never ends while you argue with those drunk with the above described concoction.

Explain to the man. He has a first impression that often hit is someone when looking in on the open source community. Anyway Dave : RedHat and these other corps that create linux distros make money off packaging a conveniently shrink wrapped linux version for you with quick start guides etc and they also offer you tech support as a part of the purchase agreement. OTOH , if you buy a $ 2 CD , then you only have a CD and you are on your own. No-one is obligated to help you with anything. An enterprise will not use an operating system where there isnt a source of reliable and competent tech support. RedHat is one of the suppliers of this tech support for a fee. What do they do with the money for these tech support charges ? Well they put food on the table and also employ developers to enhance their distro to make it even more appealing to the public/enterprises who are interested in deploying linux. This is the source of fuel for the development of , for example , KDE and Gnome. So , in the end , their current customers are happy with the enhancements , they attract new customers and the whole OSS community benefits from these enhancements.

If youve a given amount of "" destructive energy "" available , maximal destruction level will be obtained when you subdivide it into packets of size sufficient to destroy or severely damage an individual target. If the packets are significantly larger than that you get an overkill and total destruction is reduced ( since there are fewer energy packets ) . Smaller than that , and the destruction is reduced again. Thus the issue of "" what is the target ? "" enters into this. In the case of the comet I would distinguish between surface destruction ( wiping out towns , forests etc. ) and seismic destruction where the hits are sufficiently powerful to crack Earth crust and cause earth quakes and vulcanic activity. A switch with your permition. In a privious post you were addressing vaguely to the predicted ejecta as optimistic. I wonder if you can elaborate whether you can actually estimate a crater size/shape vs velocity , mass , shape , energy release rate , impact cross section , target material and structure ? If you have some rule of a thumb for such estimation please post or mail. An upper and lower barriers/limits are welcome too. I really dont know how to do it. An extremely complex problem , for sure. I would guess that military must have some information to the effect , if only empirical one. . To my knowledge , no such impact scale was ever directly observed and measured in real time. Other that. All the non-military data , involves highly extrapolated calculations on small scale experiments or on simplifications to enable computation. Then it is the military data thats needed.

I have a spotless driving record and take great pride in working for this company. I am married with two small children. On August 25 , 1999 , after coming back from vacation. I learned that I have Small Cell Carcinoma in the advanced stage. I was mortified ; what did I do to deserve such a disease ? After extensive research , I discovered how I had set myself up for getting lung cancer. Smoking for thirty years , starting when I was just fifteen years old. Back then smoking was the in-thing to do ; everybody smoked. Today , driving a truck , I was smoking three packs a day. Only diet rivals tobacco smoke as a cause of cancer in the U.S. , accounting for a comparable number of fatalities each year. Animal ( saturated ) fat in general and red meat in particular are associated with several cancers ; both are strongly linked to malignancies of the colon and rectum ; saturated fats have been implicated in prostate cancer as well. The food from our diet is high in fat , salt and chemicals. On the road we dont get enough exercise , and we gain weight. I know I gained 45 pounds.

"( big cut ) Since you ( e.g. , Charliew ) work for an oil company , how do you feel about what is happening in Nigeria ? .the people starving while those who run the place gather their millions/billions ( along with Shell and BP Amoco ? ) Do oil companies not have consciences ? .apparently not Do the people who work for oil companies have consciences ? I will let you answer that one. The last time I checked , it was the function of government to ensure a system of laws and procedures that allowed people to survive and prosper. Why isnt the Nigerian government taxing the oil companies in order to support its population ? Whether or not you realize it , Jean , it is the primary function of corporations to maximize their profits for their stockholders. This is more amoral than immoral , but corporations are NOT legally , ethically , or morally bound to provide for the populations of foreign governments. If you think otherwise , you are living in a fantasy world. So what happens when certain nations cry "" free trade , free trade "" over and over again to the WTO in order to erode government control over social matters ? What happens when consumers are duped into believing ( or willingly adopt the belief ) that the products they buy are made under acceptable conditions , when they simply arent. This Christmas , will you be buying your kids toys made in Chinese sweatshops ? If the sweatshop toy is $ 5 cheaper than the others , how about then ? I bet you wouldnt even know which is which. If corporations have no responsibility to conduct their operations in a responsible way ( environmentally , socially , and fiscally ) then we are well and truly screwed as a society. If corporations had an advertising budget of zero , then I would buy your claim that they are amoral. But when they actively promote certain behaviours in the market , they bring 1 million consumers along for the moral ride too. Corporations are responsible for the human conditions they create where they do business. One other thing . if you think the oil firms arent aiding and abetting the Nigerian govt ( paying their "" processing fees "" and "" hidden taxes "" ) then you are the one living in a fantasy world. \ \ Thomas Rohricht - CO2 Creative environmentally sensitive graphics and design "" I wouldnt mind having multiple personalities , just so long as they all got along and could work together on a project "" - anonymous - \ \

She does this because in her mind murders based on ethnicity are morally worse than murders committed for other reasons including random and arbitrary quotas. This itself is a very dubious moral postion. In order to make the Shoa appear morally worse under these conditions it is necessary for her to deny the ethnic component of Stalins murders. The Soviet documentation on the deportations is quite clear that the deportations were undertaken solely for ethnic reasons , not political reasons , not randomly , not arbitrarly and not for military necessity.

"I agreed that the flaw in SR cancept as proposed by Einstein is the : synchronization procedure. Calling it a flaw doesnt make it one. : However , when applied as proposed , it IS totally internally consistent Especially , if , as he postulated , the absolute velocity of light in either his "" empty space "" or Lorentzs equally stationary ether , is correct. The only thing "" inconsistent "" is that he defined the result - offset local times per consecutive clock in the direction of a given systems absolute motion - as "" synchronism "" . They are "" esynched "" , not truly synchronous. But in LET "" true synchrony "" is unobservable. So why bother with the complications of worrying about what you cant possibly observe ? Indeed , more : what can not possibly affect any physical outcome whatsoever ? Just because you dont like how a term ( in this case synchony ) is defined for formal treatment , doesnt make the formal use of that term incorrect. You could claim with equal justice that "" force "" as newton used it in F = dp/dt isnt REALLY force , not TRUE force , because it excludes force of personality , and force of arms , and was even distinct from force as used by other authors , and it should instead be called "" nforce "" . In short , nattering on and on about "" synchony "" being "" really esync "" is a completely bankrupt complaint. "" Synchrony "" is ( roughly ) greek for "" same time "" . And thats exactly how Einstein uses the term. And finally , to be consistent , it is NOT enough that one simply choose a synchrony to make lightspeed isotropic. If there were a maxwellian ether , or if the laws of nature were galilean invariant , then such a choice is possible in one and only one frame. The fact that it is MEASURABLY POSSIBLE in any frame you choose is the central physical implication of SR. In LET , you presume the physical implications and derive measured anisotropy. In SR you presume anisotropy and derive the physical implications. SR is a good deal cleaner , and a more fruitful and insightful way round .

"David , Do you know of any FAQ that would allow a Linux newbie like me to setup sendmail for mail relaying from a DMZ as you described ? Right now I am thinking of installing a SonicWall/DMZ and need to make a decision on whether I should let SMTP trough the FW to my Exchange server ( dont like the thought ) or using relay , but dont want to put a NT box into my DMZ just for relaying when a linux box does the same better and cheaper. I have some experience with setting up Linux as a DNS and web server in a lab environment , but sendmail makes me shiver . Thanks , Daniel Sidler to reply via e-mail , remove xxxs from address. Say no to spam. Gregg , With sonicwall/10 ( w/o DMZ ) I think you can just open one port ( SMTP ) to the mail server through the firewall. This does allow anyone to exploit any hole they find in the MS Exchange IMC , but the rest of the services on the exchange machine should be blocked. Personally , what I do is run use a dual homed web server ( IIS4 ) which is connected outside the firewall ( and has nothing useful on it ) to relay mail. IIS4 includes a very limited SMTP mail server service which I have set up to relay mail to our domain ( it will not relay any other domains ) . Our DNS MX entry points to the relay machine. Since all mail is immediately relayed to the exchange server , the relay machine never has any mail ( other than a small queue ) on it and it has no user accounts on it. You may want to put together a cheap linux or Windows system that relays mail from outside the firewall to accept/send mail. There appear to be plenty of free/cheap SMTP mail servers available. That way if it becomes compromised there is not much there worthwhile. includes a built in email proxy that does this ( but it is more expensive than sonicwall and you have to supply the hardware ) . David Abrams We have a single NT4 ( SP5 ) LAN server running file&print , Exch 5.5 sp2 ( uses ETRN on IMC to retrieve from ISP - works great ) , IIS4 ( intranet only ) using Wingate 3.0.5 and 56k modem as DOD router/firewall. We are now moving to DSL and therefor needing a real firewall solution. We have MSProxy v2 license available and are considering using SonicWall-10 also. ( Stateful inspection & proxy cache ? ) . 1 - Is this a recommended solution ? 2 - How are we best to connect the Exchange server without putting it outside the firewall ( DMZ ) ? Is this possible ?

Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. What surprised me is that the team has more depth than last year even with injuries and holdouts. This was only one game , but the roster itself simply looks better than last years to me. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. Steve Kariya did well too , in my opinion. I see why he made the team. Mogilny had some jump himself ! I bet losing ten pounds was only a good thing for him. I remember that Stephane Quintal did this last year and he instantly got more jump on the ice. It is so much easier to skate around when you got ten less pounds to carry. And he was more aggressive. He needs to go straight to the Net sometimes , though , not just wait for the late man to take his pass. He scored more than 50 goals in the past , he should take shots. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do.

"I attended the game , so here are my thoughts. Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. He stole the game for us , more or less. He was generally quite good , if a little flamboyant and lucky. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. The defense , to me , looked fairly porous. Jovanoski was a monster , trying to hit everything that moved , but seemed incapable of generating any offense. Chris Joseph , while alright in the offensive zone , looked particularly mediocre in his own zone. Baron has acquired the dreaded Murzyn syndrome , taking penalties because he cant keep up with the opposition. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do. What most impressed me tonight was that the team looked better coached than it has in years. Lines were well-managed , the break-outs were relatively clean , and they ( particularly the third line ) cycled the puck well. With the exception of Messier , the forwards seemed to be back-checking well. One player that surprised me tonight was Peter Schaefer. With limited ice-time he stood out and played a complete game. He was rewarded with a couple of shifts with Messier , powerplay and penalty-killing time and an assist. He certainly looked encouraging. The same could be said for Chubarov , who was less impressive ( and a bit gawky ) but not out of place. DB .

"Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. The argument he is offering is that if you have deflation , then currency becomes an interest bearing asset , since its real value is going up. This is the source of the so-called "" liquidity trap. "" If the deflation rate becomes high enough , the nominal interest rate should become negative ( because the dollars borrowers pay back are increasing in value faster than the real interest rate borrowers are willing to pay ) , so nobody investsthey just accumulate cash instead. In your answer , you have just reinvented one of the responses offered to this argument at the timethe real balances effect. As , in such a scenario , prices plunge down , all those people holding all that cash are getting an implicit income in the increasing value of their cashsome of which they will spend. I am not aware of any evidence that the phenomenon in question ever actually happened. As best I recall , the reason people paid attention to the theoretical idea was the mistaken belief that the Great Depression started and continued in spite of inflationary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. If that had been true , it would have raised the question of why the increased amount of money didnt start prices back up , as neoclassical monetary theory implied it should. Hence the metaphor that using monetary policy to expand was like pushing on a string. In fact , as we know know , the Feds actual policy was deflationaryas best I recall , the drop in the money supply from about 1929 to 1931 ( this isnt my field , and I am working from memory , so dont guarantee exact dates and numbers ) was several times larger than the largest previous percentage drop in the history of the U.S. For details , see _A Monetary History of the U.S._ by Friedman and Schwartz ( a different Friedman ) , or _The Great Contraction_ , which is the chapter on the Great Depression from that book , published separately.

"I am going to start a design of a low cost Z80 based computer as hobby.

You get most of the peripherals built-in , and when you get bored with the project you can turn it into something at least vaguely useful : I have a very soft spot for the Z80 , as it was the machine I cut my microprocessor teeth on ; but the world has moved on since CP/M. But maybe just maybe. it could be a fun thing to do. Come to think of it , maybe I should dust-off the old Z80 CP/M box in the attic this weekend ; Jonathan Bromley I gave away my CPM computers years ago. Except for the exercise , why design another ? Don Before you buy. Maybe to regain control of what the computer does and when. Instead of beliving that Microsoft has the knowlegde to control the PC at any time without a blue-screen : . Hardware and software vendors today are very "" we love MS "" likely. And that controls prices and envirroment. And by the way INTEL has ones admited that Z80 compared to Pentium and Pentium Pro , was faster in block moves ( if you look away from the clock signal differences ) .

"In Warp 4 IBM added a little check box on the second "" Source Directory "" screen which said "" Use files from hard disk if they exist. "" The reason for this was to use the most up-to-date file versions installed from fixpacks in creating the utility disks rather than the downlevel GA files. A great idea but a bug in the program prevented it from working if you checked the box. If you dont check the box , the 4 utility boxes are still created from the GA files like always. Apparently this bug is fixed in fixpack 12 for Warp v4. I suspect that the Create Utility Disks program in Warp Connect has a similar bug. Try it with the box unchecked and see what happens. There is no such checkbox for Warp Connects version of this function. In fact , ALL files are copied from the current hard drive. whatever they are , whatever level they are at , and however they got there. I looked at a machine with OS/2 v3 installed and started the Create Disks program. You are right , the program does not provide an option for selection of the files. When the program starts , the first thing it does is look at the floppy drive and the drive should briefly light up and bump a little. Then the Create Utility Disks screen pops up and asks you to select a drive where the diskettes will be created. After you select A or B , another screen pops up asking you to insert the diskette for that drive. After you do this , it tells you that the disk will be formatted , formats the disk , and starts copying files from the hard drive to the floppy. The first file is OS2BOOT , then OS2LDR , OS2VER , and OS2KRNLI in that order. So does any of this stuff happen for you ? If not , I would suspect a problem with the floppy drive or the floppy drive driver. Since you say the floppy is working properly , I am puzzled. Perhaps the program checks for system file first before starting the floppy bump. Since your system boots properly and accepts a fixpack service , I can not imagine what could be missing. Sorry I cant be more helpful .

Asked doc to try level l.because seems like least side effects of any tried so far.Think maybe lower strength would be less of pill hangover feeling. QuestionAll above drugs seem to control pressurebut Hytrin seems to have least problem. Is Hytrin used very often for hypertension ? Any input.comments welcome.Thank you again for inputAnnie

After the install program wiped out my desktop and a whole day to recover , I finally have things back to normal. Now , I dont necessarily blame Snow Storm Software and their install program for the crash since this system has been running continuously since OS/2 2.0 ( Warp 4 fp10 at the moment ) . But to the point. EscapeGL is a wonderful screensaver and has all kinds of new modules. Unfortunately , it loves to crash. I have installed oglgold from IBM.

"I currently run Win98 on a stand alone system at home. I have 128mgs of RAM and it is a P3 550. I want to switch to a more powerful operating system. I have used NT before and liked it , but I have been reading a lot about OS2 and Linux recently. I have a couple of questions : 1 ) I am a fairly technically apt person , but I am not a technical professional. Which of these will probably be easiest to install ? My judgment is that Linux is still the most difficult to install & get all the necessary services running. And NT the easiest. 2 ) Regardless of which system I choose , will I need to reformat the hard drive first , or will if I choose NT will I be able to install on top of Win98 ? You do have the option of buying PARTITION MAGIC which will allow you to shrink your current partition & create free space & then create a new partition for your new OS. That assumes your present partition is not completely filled with files that you are unwilling to give up. 3 ) Will OS2 and Linux run Window applications like MS Office , Quicken as well as lesser known applications ? OS2 will run old WIN 3.1 applications very well , but not WIN95 or WIN98 or WINNT aplications. Microsoft tries to force or encourage independent software vendors to make their products compatible with the all Windows OSes , but many dont. If an old Windows App was not designed specifically to be WINNT compatible , it likely will not be. Linux has only very limited compatibility with any Win Apps although there has been an effort to create that compatibility for years. Linux does come with lots of its own software though. 4 ) Can OS2 and Linus rund new SCSI controllers , scanners , monitors , modems , network cards as easily as Microsoft ? OS2 depends mostly on hardware vendors to write drivers compatible with OS2. Fewer & fewer now do that as OS2 loses market share. If you choose OS2 you need to make a careful selection of a video adaptor card in particular. Nearly all hardware vendors write drivers for WINNT as well as other WINs because thats where the market is. Linux depends on individual volunteers to write drivers & they do that very well because there are a great many of them & they personally own a great variety of new & old hardware that they want to run under Linux. 4 ) If I decide on NT , would I be better off waiting for Windows 2000 ? I would personally wait at this point. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Walt

After all , everthing single piece of information , that my brain has received , was , at some stage , just an electrical pulse on a nerve firbe. From that , my mind constructed the internal graphic that I call the universe , which includes my own body. All of our science and its experiments are directed at trying to understand the nature of external reality AS OUR MINDS CONCEIVE IT ! I think you are making a categorical error. There is no doubt that Reality , at some fundamental level , is substantially different from what we perceive it to be. But the question you asked is "" does the external world have a form which is observer independent ? "" and unless I am mistaken , what the phrase "" external world "" refers to is the world apart from our perceptions. That "" form "" the external world possesses may be very different from what we perceive but it certainly must have a definite form however strange. Rejection ( of ) that statement is possible , but the ultimate results of that rejection are incoherent. Except that my use of the word form is itself a little suspect. Form tends to assume a physical reality , when that is the very thing we are trying to investigate. Like I said , the form could be mathematical or something beyond our present understanding. However , there is no doubt that entities exist beyond our individual minds , and it is reasonable to speculate that they may have some kind of absolute properties. The question , "" what did the world look like before there was life ? "" sums it up. We know it existed but assigning physical properties mean nothing unless they refer back to a definition by a conscious observer. We can make statements like "" trees are green "" but green is only part of the minds internal language. Without life , trees merely reflect light of certain predominant wavelengths , where the words in parenthesis are products of our own understanding of form anyway. Maybe there is no purpose in speculating about true form because we are never going to know what it is anyway. We might as well stick with the one we know !

"Dennis : Positivism restricts itself to "" what is seen in nature "" and mathematics is simply a symbolic tool for describing what is seen in nature. It are the materialists and objective realists who try to go beyond just descriptions of what is seen in natureand hypothesize underlying material causes. All we can know directly is what we perceive with the senses we have. Any other knowledge is indirect , resting on hypothesis and inference. Since we do not have the senses to see all the way to the bottom of reality the BEST we can do is posit hypothesis and hope they predict what we do see. Even if an hypothesis predicts correctly , that is not a basis for saying it is true. In order to do that you have to eliminate every other hypothesis that yield the same prediction. You are asking more of your senses and your limited mental capacity ( not just yours , but all of us ) than they can produce , if you think we can find the TRUTH with any certainty. The history of science is littered with bust theories , each of which was believed to be TRUE at one time. The best we can come up with is a progression of models that predict what we will perceive under various circumstances. Bob Kolker

"You might be up to something here , but it is not the average temperature. These experiments are done in controlled environment of buildings. If the temoerature had something to do with it in this manner , there would be pronounced difference between day and night weight and between equator and pole weight. There are differences , but nothing of 5 % magnitude. I suppose the weight gain was arived at mathematicaly from the behaviour of the pendulum , rather then from weighing the pendulum on a spring scale. One has to be carefull with drawing the conclusions when mathematics is used. I still think though , that the thermal radiation is the main product of random material behaviour while the gravitation is a different quantum order byproduct. Regards Slavek. Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. Question ; during a solar eclipse does the average temperature of the environment decrease ? So dont you have in the first case temperature decrease causes weight loss and in the second case temperature decrease causes weight gain ?

"But do you actually SEE more detail at magnifications beyond the 50x or so ( 80x for high quality refractors and long focal length high quality reflectors ) ? I know the conventional wisdom says , "" No "" , and in this case I am included to agree , based on views through a high quality 6 inch refractor and VERY steady seeing conditions. On a few nights over the past several years , seeing conditions at the observatory were such that on one night I could see very thin shadows on the walls of craters on the moon several hours before Full Moon. On those nights I experimented with pushing the mags past the 80x per inch aperture limit , and found that while the image was magnified , I could not see more detail on the Moon , Mars , or Jupiter ( on different nights ) . And on an SCT optical system , with that large secondary , I have not successfully seen more detail at mags much higher than 40x per inch aperture , through a C8 or a C5 + , despite excellent seeing conditions. Yes , the image was larger , but I could not see more details. So I conclude that you can save your money on short focal length eyepieces and just learn to see more details at lower mags. I am oh so tempted to add a 3mm TV Radian to my C8.

"After I claimed time was at least in part a result of human psychology , since our minds were involved in the "" perception of time "" , No , it means that the ability/capability of perceiving time is a result of human mentality. But , in agreement with an earlier part of your statement above , time itself is "" something out there "" . Yeah , good point. I was sloppy about the distinction between "" actual physically out there time "" and "" humanly perceived time "" and it is a sloppiness that is damnably hard to get around. I kinda expect that some day , a very clever dude is going to propose something a bit like the quantum mechanical restriction that observation effects the observed , but in the context of time. Our observation of fundamental particles , changes them . might our consciousness of the passage of time effect well SOMETHING , but what ? GaryFostel- I stand by my theory that there are two and maybe three Time dimensions. Lets call absolute time , T1 , and relative time T2. Humans have an internal psychological sensor that detects T2. T1 doesnt move. All its values exist like an infinite measuring stick in space. Rocks and other animals dont generally sense T2. Our clocks , using physical properties , tick according to dT2/dT1 , the rate of change of relative time , wrt T1. They continually integrate this to read T2. As with lengths , one hour of T2 has been calibrated , BY US , as being identical to one hour of T1 and therefore appears to be the SAME quantity. That is the source of all the mystery and confusion about TIME. As a spatial analogy , whether we move ten metres upwards or ten metres sideways , we still end up ten metres from where we started. With time , if we add ten hours to our T1 coordinate or ten hours to our T2 coordinate , either our bodies or our minds age , but it makes little difference in the long run , except that T2 does not appear to increase during sleep or coma. We are physically conceived , lifeless , at a particular T1 , and our bodies , like all physical things , change according to T1. Our consciousness , like life itself , is a portrayal of relationships between T1 , T2 and dT2/dT1 and goes off on a tangent. Get it ?

"Finally , it came time to build my Utility Diskettes. And it was now that I unfortunately had a total failure ! Almost immediately upon starting the function , I am getting an error message popup that says : An error occurred while copying system files. Utility disks can not be created. In Warp 4 , the original "" Create Utility Disks "" program was something called "" bootdisk.exe "" and created four utility diskettes using the original files on the install CD-ROM. Then , starting in fixpack 5 or so , IBM added a little check box on the second "" Source Directory "" screen which said "" Use files from hard disk if they exist. "" The reason for this was to use the most up-to-date file versions installed from fixpacks in creating the utility disks rather than the downlevel GA files. A great idea but a bug in the program prevented it from working if you checked the box. If you dont check the box , the 4 utility boxes are still created from the GA files like always. Apparently this bug is fixed in fixpack 12 for Warp v4. I suspect that the Create Utility Disks program in Warp Connect has a similar bug. Try it with the box unchecked and see what happens. If that does not help , look at the source directory for the utility disk files. Did you install from CD-Rom or diskettes ? Is the letter of the source drive correct or has it changed during your new installation ? Is the CD-ROM or install diskettes physically in the source drive ? The program will terminate if these things are wrong. I doubt that your video install method had anything to do with the create utility disks program. The program is basically pretty simple and just copies a lot of files .

Congratulations , you will now be paying about 4 times the deflated value for your house. Not to mention the impact on your other debts. One big thing people overlook in a deflationary cycle , your income goes down. Companies will cut pay too at least match the level of deflation. Deflation leads to money hoarding , which draws more money from the market , leading to more deflation. Everybody tries to keep his money as long as possible , buying only the baremost necessities , and this as late as he can. The result is , of course , collapse. Talk me through this , okay ? Suddenly all the money in my pocket is worth 5 % more than it was. Which means I suddenly can buy 5 % more stuff than I could before. Which means I will instead decide to buy nothing ? No , my friend , if you truly think that , then you are obviously no student of human nature. Only if prices drop to match the deflation rate. The prices that do drop should be food and very little else. Most durable goods price will remain the same until companies can figure out a way to drop them without going bankrupt. Your argument against deflation is that "" it leads to money hoarding. "" This is patently untrue , thus your argument has no base. Unless I am missing something. ? Income drops as Companies cut pay or have massive layoffs. Large Companies would be very hard hit. They are stuck with inventory and products that are highly overpriced and they can not cut prices with the suddenly increased debt hanging over them.

A MUCH more reliable backup package , and it ships with an older copy of BOOTOS2 going to great length to instruct you that this is the only method any software can use to get reliable backups. There is nothing you can really do to recover from this. Your backup solution simply doesnt work. Roland I received Back Again/2 , installed it with no problem , did a back up with little problem , and tried to do a restore with some problems. : ) I seem to remember when I was wandering through the back up discussion archives that there was some talk about files that dont get backed up because they are open , or cant be restored for a similar reason. I am having that problem now. When I did a full back up on my C : drive ( OS/2 Warp 4 FP10 ) , there were about four or five files it said it couldnt open , so I had it skip them. Then when I tried doing a full restore of all the files , there is a whole log full of tons of files that couldnt be restored because they couldnt be opened. I have read the manual , but it is pretty spare on talking about this sort of thing. I havent gotten to the web site yet , but I was just there a few days ago , and there wasnt much there.

"I very recently starting studying Shorin-Ryu Karate , and from what I understand it emphasizes striking and kicking , with not as much emphasis on throwing and grappling. Scott , You are spot on. The grappler/striker debate has been waged repeatedly in this NG. I reserve comment in this regard. In the Okinawan Karate systems that I am familiar with , beginner waza typically focus on block , kick , punch. The throwing , grappling , pressure points , etc are usually introduced at a more advanced level. Check with the yudansha in your dojo to see if they indeed have this advanced bunkai in their portfolio. Not all instructors have this knowledge even though it is contained within the system. Often those who do have this knowledge will introduce it later in the training. One tool that I introduce early on is change body ( dodging ) . Learning to move , get out of the way and position yourself favorably will be beneficial no matter what an aggressor throws at you. Later on , change body provides an entry for more advanced things like grappling , throwing , joint and point manipulation.

"Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. To me with this work and Schnurers work the superconductor is too small to produce an observable change of weight. But I am not sure. And its hard to separate out the effect of the liquid nitogen fumes. I get a 2.9 % weight loss by illuminating the insides of a 0.82 m hollow aluminum sphere with 3000 watts of infrared heat. With a colander and the same power I get a 1.6 % weight loss. I have also made control runs to separage the spurious heat effects from the genuine gravity effects. Another thing : My test mass looks more like a UFO than does Podkketnovs or Schnurers test mass. Why do UFOs hover silently ? Could they be kicking heat out the bottom like my 0.82 m hemisphere does ? UFOs are touchy when a light is flashed on them. When I take a photo of my device during a test a slight change of weight occurs at the instance of the flash from the camera. Peter Fred But what is it bouyant in ? Could not anti-gravity be a form of bouyancy within the field of gravity ? If not exactly by definition at least by appearence.

"A further point is that not only would a drum recorder prevent signals being missed when the instrument isnt being watched , it would also provide permanent records that could be passed around to interested parties. Roger Musson Some time ago Dennis posted that it was _not possible_ ( due to their inherent nature ) to record the signals. From the context , it was quite clear that it was not due to any lack of equipment or funds , but that it was some feature of the signals themselves that prevented recording. Nobody really seemed to pick up on that , but it seemed like an extremely odd assertion to me. And so far nobody has asked ( so far as I know ) for a very general description of the nature of the emanations. Seems to me that he would not give the game away too much by just indicating whether they are electromagnetic , seismic , barometric , sonic , psychic , tidal , astronomical , or what. Dennis has taken interest in his theory to be evidence of support for his prediction aspirations. I shall quite honestly admit what I think others know of themselves.

Our observation of fundamental particles , changes them . might our consciousness of the passage of time effect well SOMETHING , but what ? -GaryFostel- I stand by my theory that there are two and maybe three Time dimensions. Lets call absolute time , T1 , and relative time T2. Humans have an internal psychological sensor that detects T2. T1 doesnt move. All its values exist like an infinite measuring stick in space. Rocks and other animals dont generally sense T2. Our clocks , using physical properties , tick according to dT2/dT1 , the rate of change of relative time , wrt T1. They continually integrate this to read T2. As with lengths , one hour of T2 has been calibrated , BY US , as being identical to one hour of T1 and therefore appears to be the SAME quantity. That is the source of all the mystery and confusion about TIME. As a spatial analogy , whether we move ten metres upwards or ten metres sideways , we still end up ten metres from where we started. With time , if we add ten hours to our T1 coordinate or ten hours to our T2 coordinate , either our bodies or our minds age , but it makes little difference in the long run , except that T2 does not appear to increase during sleep or coma. We are physically conceived , lifeless , at a particular T1 , and our bodies , like all physical things , change according to T1. Our consciousness , like life itself , is a portrayal of relationships between T1 , T2 and dT2/dT1 and goes off on a tangent. Get it ? Get it.

The Built With Amiga Software site has pointers to a variety of such tools from several authors ( hey , you knew I left that open for you my friend. : ) Hoping you would take the ball and run . Mind you , personally I just use GoldEd and hsc - a more powerful combination for website creation I have yet to find on any platform , in all honesty ! : ) Good combo , but then start making interactive sites with hundreds of pages. Knowing that you can cut and paste , throw templates across multiple pages in one pass , support nested tables and layers properly , etc makes a growing site like Owlnet turn from an abomination to do into something much easier. I agree that smaller sites with less than 15 pages are fun to code by hand , but add another 100 plus pages to that with limited time to get them all out and you can see my frustration. Dream Weaver , for instance , can take a template site wide in about 1 minutes with a large site , almost as a batch process. Now do that by hand to change one silly thing "" like copyright 1998-1999 "" to "" copyright 1998-2000 "" and do it over 150-200 pages. : ( Gary Peake , TAC-OwlNet.Net Team AMIGA Central We provide free web sites for small developers Sometimes you are the windshield , sometimes you are the bug !

"Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. My words. Gravity is related to mass as its acts on material structures. But that is all. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Thank you. Any refference ? Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work. To me with this work and Schnurers work the superconductor is too small to produce an observable change of weight. But I am not sure. And its hard to separate out the effect of the liquid nitogen fumes. I get a 2.9 % weight loss by illuminating the insides of a 0.82 m hollow aluminum sphere with 3000 watts of infrared heat. With a colander and the same power I get a 1.6 % weight loss. I have also made control runs to separage the spurious heat effects from the genuine gravity effects. Did you accont for convection of surrounding air ? I looked at your page and from what I could figure out , this aspect may have been omited. Another thing : My test mass looks more like a UFO than does Podkketnovs or Schnurers test mass. Why do UFOs hover silently ? Could they be kicking heat out the bottom like my 0.82 m hemisphere does ? UFOs are touchy when a light is flashed on them. When I take a photo of my device during a test a slight change of weight occurs at the instance of the flash from the camera. How good is this statement ? I mean how certain are you ?

Whether it is a victory for farmers or consumers is extremely doubtful. Farmers would have had their choice as to whether to use the technology or not.

When we are talking about deaths from woodsmoke , we are talking about places with an extremely low level of technology. Providing efficient stoves would be a far more realistic solution to this problem. In practice it is likely that efficient stoves could be produed locally ( from clay or even unburnt earth ) at a tiny fraction of the cost of a swish stainless steel job. The Swedes could afford to donate efficient stoves to the poorest of the poor if they chose to meet their Kyoto targets by using nuclear power rather than more expensive alternatives. They might even be able to donate nuclear power plants to run stainless steel stove factories. There is a certain national pride of self-sufficiency though , so I suppose local coal will be preferred to foreign uranium as the stainless steel stove factory fuel of choice. All the more reason why those who can use uranium should use uranium to make more room in the atmospheric CO2 store for those who cant or wont. No , the only argument for nuclear is in those countries which a ) can afford it , having surplus GNP to invest Including China , India , Pakistan , Brazil , Argentina , Mexico , . Indonesia just built a huge new coal plant for the same money they could have had a nuclear plant. b ) already are producing such unreasonable quantities of CO2 that they need to reduce them , and Most of the CO2 in the next century ( which is most of the CO2 expected to be produced under b.a.u. ) will come from developing countries , not developed countries. c ) are politically capable of taking on board such a curates egg. ?

"Which is more efficient at producing energy from the sun ? Would it make sense to let plants collect the sunrays and then perform chemical processes on the plants to extract the energy ? Z Do you mean like growing trees and burning the wood ? : Sure but it takes a fair bit of effort to get the plant energy into forms readily usable by society , on top of the fact that the best land for growing many plants is often where we want to grow food. But to answer your first question IIRC the efficiency of the best solar cells is now somewhere in the vicinity of a bit over 20 % ( I am sure someone will correct me by posting the latest record or something ) but I dont know what the equivalent figure is for plants. I imagine it depends on the type of plant and how it is used for energy , e.g. corn turned into ethanol gives one efficiency , trees turned into firewood another , but I really dont know for sure. You also have to figure in the energy required to produce the energy ( manufacturing solar cells versus planting , havesting , processing , etc. for plants ) if you want the total picture.

I have decided that it would be a good idea to begin studies again , while I am still relatively young. However , I would like to begin anew in another style. The problem is , with hundreds of styles and forms and variations on those , it is hard to decide. So , my first question is , what would be your recommendation.

If I were to ever be assaulted or something like that , I would want to be able to defend myself. The one problem that I saw with karate is that it was such a hard style that the only way I could really defend myself was by pulverizing the attacker. I would like to have an option to use hard force if I must , but to also defend myself without injuring anyone if at all possible. ( It may seem a little juvenile and impractical , but I would also be interested in training in a weapons style at some point , as I find it very interesting ) It would be nice , also , to train in a style that would improve my overall health.

"Nowhere in the article , did it say whether or not the stuff is toxic to other species. ( except humans ) If this stuff is toxic solely to the mosquito larvae , then it looks like a winner. If it is toxic to other forms , then there will be a problem. 9 out of 10 voices in my head say I am not crazy , so there. reply to squale5atgodotcom Up till now , I hadnt heard about any GM products that concerned me about their safety. A few transplanted genes arent going make a tomato feel pain or let you squeeze blood from a turnip. The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product , like cotton , would turn into an insect-resistant , herbicide-resistant , uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae , so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae , and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae , what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild ? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ ( the water flea ) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff ( like fish ) eat the mosquito larvae , the _Daphnia_ , etc. If this organism gets out of control , it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon , I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle , because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels , like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment , which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible .

"This is a message from Paul Lesurf of Blittersort posted to the Fusion Mailing List ; To all Amiga emulation users , Blittersoft would like to make a statement regarding the response to the Fusion PPC Amiga situation. Whilst Microcode Solutions announced the 60 day countdown on September 20th , there was not the required 500 prepayments that were supposed to trigger this. As announced by Microcode Solutions , Blittersoft made the commitment for 500 orders to enable this product to actually see the light of day. This was made with some confidence given the many users who stated they would pay after the countdown began. Unfortunately , despite over 600 pledges , we have seen about a third actually prepay. Many have declined to authorise and the situation is that we have backed this process believing the Amiga community who made a commitment would actually follow through and keep their word. This is despite the countdown being close to half way. Whilst I accept that there will be those who circumstances may effect the ability to complete their pledge , I think it is fair to say that this would cater for a handful. It is sad to report that many people who pledged must have done so without ever considering the consequences of failing to meet this pledge. Well , the consequences are that Blittersoft will not make this type of gesture again. The same situation could well happen with the PCx PC software. Again , there have been many requests ( about 350 ) and it is Microcodes intention is to begin the countdown for this after the Fusion PPC is released and 500 pledges become 500 payments. Blittersoft will be prepared to make the same gesture and back the product to the tune of 500 orders if we receive the level of support promised by the Amiga emulation community. Everyone knows the situation with Amiga development. Piracy is still a big problem and now it seems that even planned schemes to secure development can also not be trusted. The bottom line is that the Amiga needs quality support by it is users if there is still to be quality development. I will end with a simple request : If you did pledge your suppport to pre-pay Fusion PPC and have not done so , please reconsider and do so now. Best wishes , Paul Lesurf Blittersoft see "" How to Overclock ! "" Got an overclocking story to tell of /any/ kind ? Send it to me and I will post it to my "" Overclockers Web Page "" .

"I run FreeBSD quite heavily , and I can see where FreeBSD and Linux could be a benefit to each other. Both are free , open source UNICES. I believe that FreeBSD is just as important to the OSS movement as Linux. Many Linuxers would have you believe that this isnt necessarily the case , since FreeBSD isnt nearly as popular as Linux. But , this is OK. I am primarily a Linux advocate , but bear no ill will toward FreeBSD whatsoever. It too is a great free OS , with most of the same strengths as Linux as well as a few of its own. Either is light years ahead of NT in any kind of a server role. I would differ from some of the rabidly anti-GPL folks , because I think both the GPL and the more BSD-like licenses both have their place in the free software movement. But I think that FreeBSD is a benefit to Linux , and vice versa. I agree completely. Neither OS could have become what it is today without the other. I only wish there as more of a spirit of friendly competition and cooperation between the two camps. I dont understand the anomosity I sometimes witness between them. As best I can tell , it is completely unjustified. For example , FreeBSD would never have had the massive amount of free software ( such as xemacs , WindowMaker , gcc , to name a few ) if it werent for the demand for this software created by people running Linux to begin with. OTOH , having BSD in addition to Linux might create just enough of a free UNIX user base that companies would decide to port their software to Linux. True. Another important point is that there is a huge amount of BSD-licensed software in any useful Linux distribution. The BSD license is arguably freer in many ways than is the GPL , although inherent in that freedom is the risk that a Microsoft or some other large company might make the code proprietary , while changing the standards embodied by it making free software incompatible with what most people are using. The GPL is designed primarily to prevent this , while preserving every other kind of freedom possible , and it seems to work pretty well so far. Joe

". There is a classic demonstration concerning heat : two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror , travels through a distance to the other mirror , and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the "" heat "" radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. So is it a direct tranmission of some form of energy from one match to the other , or is the energy that lights the second match derived from energy transfers within the mirrors ? Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic , randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments ( their internal bar magnets ) .

"One aspect of the groundfighting vs. standup fighting argument which is often overlooked is energy expenditure , and how this differs in each realm. One of the things that a groundfighter knows which stand-up fighters or untrained people dont realize is the fact that it is very exhausting to fight on the ground against a person who knows position maintenance. I know wat you mean , my schools ground-grappling included some monkey stuff that focuses on wearing out your opponent. Works pretty well until the eye gouges start. Consistently , I have heavyweight athletes come in who have very good standing endurance ( from running , standup M.A. training , etc. ) and they are completely gassed on the ground in about 20 seconds even when facing a trained opponent whom they heavily outweigh. They are always surprised when they first experience this. We had some guys start running to improve their endurace during sparring , but it didnt really help. What they dont understand is the fact that real groundfighting has unique rigors to it. Even people who dabble in groundfighting and grappling dont understand this. Good stand-up fighting does too ( that grappling/impact/elbow stand-up , not standing off trading blows ( that IS more like the running stamina ) ) People who train in stand-up fighting , lift weights , run , etc. generally have pretty good standing endurance. They can explode , and send their natural weapons ( e.g. fists ) trajectorally toward a target , they can move and shuffle , advance , retreat. They do just fine here. I find that even these wight-trained people lack endurance. We get them down thighs paralell and they run out of steam fast. So , grappling works against both the standing mans instincts and his conditioned actions and responses. So then. If a person demonstrates the ability to knock your head off while standing , and you cant match this ability in return , you can take all of this away from him by taking him to the ground. He wont have the same leverage or knowledge to do what he wants to do once you take it to the ground. Moreover , he wont find this out until it is already too late. Take a standup fighter to the ground. Good strategy. Opposite strateg , make a grappler face you upright. ( cant keep him upright , but you can trow stuff at him then ) This says nothing of multiple opponent strategies , etc. The above merely describes an important phenomen which can occur in a one on one situation.

"On Thu , 14 Oct 1999 -0400 , "" Al , N2NKB "" To make a cheap isolation transformer , I have often seen the suggestion to take two identical power transformers , connect their secondaries together , and use ones primary as the input and the others as the output. Would this also work : use a dual-primary transformer ( designed for switchable 120/240V operation ) , leaving the real secondaries unconnected , and using one of the primaries as the output ? What sort of isolation or protection ability would I be giving up by doing things this way ? Transformer specs normally include a rating of the insulation between primaries and secondaries , but I have never seen one that specifies the amount of insulation between the primaries ( although there obviously has to be some guarantee of such , or they could produce a short across the AC line in their normal use ) . A related question : for a project of mine , I need to supply both 5VDC , and roughly 170VDC , sharing a common ground. Would it be safe to use a dual-primary transformer , connecting only one of the primaries to the AC line , and using the other as the secondary for the high voltage output ? Jason Harper I think that you would be safe using the dual primary windings as an isolation transformer. Rubbish , most dual voltage trasnformers have the 2 primaries wound together , the insulation between them is only operational and must not be relied upon for safety isolation. Of course , double check that the resistance between the windings shows up as infinite with your ohmmeter. So an ohmmeter is as good as a flash tester and megger is it ? . Greg

"Thirdly , if it is a mechanical rotary encoder , the edges wont be clean enough to use interrupts directly , no matter what you do. The way we solved the mechanical problem is to put the program into a loop that reads portb rerpeatedly until it settles down. The following is if the A and B are the pins of interest : Isnt the normal practice to debounce the encoder as one would debounce a pushbutton switch ? Adding a 5-10 ms delay after the interrupt is first detected then checking the port again should debounce just about any mechanical input there is. He said 12.5kHz , so a 5ms debounce isnt going to work ; in any event multiple edges may not be due to bounce but due to jitter of the armature. At 12.5kHz it is bound to be an optical device. IMO the best way is to forget using the encoder inputs as interrupts. Set a timer interrupt going faster than the maximum pulse rate and scan the two inputs. If they have changed since last time , either count up or down depending on the change. Use a state machine to only allow counts on valid changes and ( if it is important ) alert the user in the event of an invalid change. This is much more satisfactory , and easy to do. Using external interrupts in this way is not very good practice ; you have no guarantee that jitter may not happen faster than your controller can respond to.

"A question just occurred to me How come all of these Hollow Earth advocates never go to this big huge hole in the ground themselves ? You know , snap a few shots , take a few samples , and then come back and stun the scientific world ? Is there a reason that they make their claims solely on the basis of satellite photos with missing data and third ( or more ) hand reports of long dead explorers ( which were probably fabricated in the first place ) ? Phillips One of your "" long-dead explorers "" was Adm. Richard E. Byrd who came of a distinguished Virginia family and who ( so far as I know ) had nothing in his history that would indicate a predisposition to fabrications of any sort. You ask why there have been no photographs. This may be because you are under a misapprehension about just exactly what you would see there. You seem to think that , as one treks northward and finally gets sufficiently close to the Pole , one would come to a gigantic circular abyss where below all was blackness and into which one dare not fall. Try to realize that the crust at the opening could have a radius of the order of a thousand miles. Thus it would be perfectly to walk around this crust and have no sense whatever of having traversed anything other than flat ground. it is very dangerous. You might fall in and never get out , and many scientists believe that the underground caverns are full of dangerous carnivorous dinosaurs. It is the same reason that astronauts are never sent to photograph black holes. Oh , come now ! Tarzan was able to make it in and back with his expedition.

This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the "" heat "" radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ?

"( Below ) Do you know if , for example , the parent plant which contained the "" terminator "" gene produces pollen ? Regards , Jim Scanlon I would have thought the environmental lobby would want GM crops to possess a terminator gene since then it necessarily be incapable of reproduction and spreading ! In the west farmers predominately buy seed anyway. As a student I once worked in a grain mill in the seed grain division where we processed and bagged the new varieties of seed grain. The process was that a limited group of farmers contracted to grow the new varieties that had been developed ( 1st generation ) having contracted to observe very stringent conditions to preserve the integrity of the crop ( and get a very good price ! ) . Their product was then processed and bagged for sale to farmers for crop production ( 2nd generation ) as the yields and disease resistance of these varieties was superior to previous varieties there was a ready market. The new varieties were produced by the national plant breeding station in the UK. At that time they were produced by conventional technology. The use of a limited number of genetic lines is a concern no matter how the seed is produced and producers and countries do maintain seedbanks for this reason , also even the evil plant breeders need a parent stock to produce their next generations from so it is certainly not in their interest to eliminate all other varieties , quite the contrary ! Farmers in the third world certainly have concerns about stability of supply but of course would still be free to plant a small corner of their field as a strategic seed reserve of conventional varieties and still benefit from the improved yield of the new varieties. I would assume that 10 % would be ample ? I sometimes wonder if some of the critics here and elsewhere have ever worked on a farm or in an agricultural community ? Phil .

"The interference you are receiving may not be in violation of any law , but it I will bet it is very annoying. There are several things you can do to try to protect your TV reception. If you are on cable ; call the cable company to have them check the system. Check all the jumpers between your VCR and TV and cable box and disconnect anything connected to the TV one at a time. Often the VCR is prone to RFI rather than the TV. If you are not on cable , attach a good HI-Pass filter between the antenna and TV. Get square ferrite chokes from radio shack and wrap all of your cables in them. Try to determine where the RF is getting into your system. Is it the AC line , the antenna line , or do you have extension speakers , or a Home Theater sound system hooked to your TV ? Any of these paths can be vulnerable. Start by just watching the TV alone with nothing else in line. Ask your neighbor politely if he will assist in the testing process. He may be a completely legal operator , in which case , YOU need to prevent the interference to your unprotected devices. Contact the manufacturer of your TV. Often they have kits you can install to prevent RFI. The FCC has an interference handbook available , which has lots more ideas. You can probably get info on it at the FCC website. Good Luck !

The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product , like cotton , would turn into an insect-resistant , herbicide-resistant , uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae , so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae , and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae , what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild ? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ ( the water flea ) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff ( like fish ) eat the mosquito larvae , the _Daphnia_ , etc. If this organism gets out of control , it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon , I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle , because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels , like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment , which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible.

"My friend is having a multimedia problem with Windows 98. When playing some longer sounds ( ie wave files ) , the sounds are : ( a ) cut off before the end ( Sound Recorder ) , or ( b ) the program plays a split second of the sound and stops. ( If he clicks again , it does the same thing but with the next part of the sound. ) This happens with the software that came with the sound driver. When playing videos files ( ie the CART demo video on the Win 98 CD ) , the sound is choppy. Video plays fine , but the sound alternates between being there and not being there over 2 to 3 second periods. The sound system on his computer is a Creative ViBRA 16 which is built into the motherboard. He is running Windows 98 on an Intel Celeron 333 MHz chip. The computer has 32 MB of RAM. We have tried reintalling updated drivers and even reinstalling Windows 98. Nothing seems to work. MIDI works fine , and playing CDs is okay , it is just the sound files.

"Paul F. Austin said : Actually , according to Keegan , Schleiffen couldnt work through the flaws in the marching plan that was key to getting all the German armies where they needed to be before the French could mobilize and get _their_ troops to the frontiers. In true Micawberish fashion Moltkes staff assumed "" something would turn up "" . It didnt and the French did. I have heard this theory too . there is an article in one of the Commands ( I think 13 or 16 ) called "" The Marching Man "" which discusses how armies were until WWII completely limited to the speed of a marching man and that the GREAT flaw in the Schleiffen Plan was that it assumed that peak march rates could be maintained for a month at a time , and resistance overrun without much slowing the armies down. Now , such an outcome was POSSIBLE. Armies have panicked in defeat before , and if the French totally collapsed and the Germans went all-out , the Schleiffen Plan could have been achieved , in my opinion. BUT . A plan which demands prolonged peak performance on the part of ones own army , and incredibly incompetent and demoralized behavior on the part of the enemy army , coupled with NO unpleasant surprises ( like Belgian resistance or a BEF ) is simply not realistic. Which of course is essentially your point , too.

"To make a cheap isolation transformer , I have often seen the suggestion to take two identical power transformers , connect their secondaries together , and use ones primary as the input and the others as the output. Would this also work : use a dual-primary transformer ( designed for switchable 120/240V operation ) , leaving the real secondaries unconnected , and using one of the primaries as the output ? What sort of isolation or protection ability would I be giving up by doing things this way ? Transformer specs normally include a rating of the insulation between primaries and secondaries , but I have never seen one that specifies the amount of insulation between the primaries ( although there obviously has to be some guarantee of such , or they could produce a short across the AC line in their normal use ) . A related question : for a project of mine , I need to supply both 5VDC , and roughly 170VDC , sharing a common ground. Would it be safe to use a dual-primary transformer , connecting only one of the primaries to the AC line , and using the other as the secondary for the high voltage output ? Jason Harper I think that you would be safe using the dual primary windings as an isolation transformer. You can consider the other primary winding as a secondary winding with a 1 : 1 turns ratio. Of course , double check that the resistance between the windings shows up as infinite with your ohmmeter. The same goes for your related question. Al

"Thank you very much for your suggestion. I have checked my firmware version and found it is 1.21. I have checked also some films scanned some days before but can not find the trace of scratch. What I recognized the difference was that I used single scan for every pictures on a strip of 4 to 6. The scratch happened when I have used batch scan mode with direct saving to disk. Will it be the safety way for using the SA-20 by setting to single scanning mode ? Thanks you again for your kindly help I load my negs in the strip holder. Yes it will scratch. Neg film is a lot softer than slide film. Also the settings stay the same and do not default each neg scanned. Check which Firmware you have in the scanner ( 1.21 Thats the number that shows along the top when you open up the Nikon scan programme ) solves some of the early problems. Rm I have a new LS-2000 scanner which I have bought for couple of weeks. Yesterday I scanned my negative with the "" ICE "" turned off , I found all photos get one or two straight lines along the direction of film feeding besides the white dots of dust. I checked the film under strong light and believed the film surface has been scarched after passing through the SA-20 strip film feeder.

"Gravity , according to my Ordered Freedom theory , is a consequence of heat flowing out of a spherical-like body in the steady state. The gravimeter with its thermally isolated test mass has obscured over the years that gravity may be related to heat and not to mass. I believe the Podkletnov effect demonstrates that gravity is heat related. I believe the large , spinning , cold ( below 77 K ) superconductor was able to cool things down enough so that a 2 % weight loss was observed. During a solar eclipse , Saxl observed a 5 % weight gain in his torsion pendulum. Of course high minded scientists with their gravimeters and efforts to thermally isolate everything have had a hard time replicating both Podkletnovs and Saxls work.

"Up till now , I hadnt heard about any GM products that concerned me about their safety. A few transplanted genes arent going make a tomato feel pain or let you squeeze blood from a turnip. The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product , like cotton , would turn into an insect-resistant , herbicide-resistant , uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae , so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae , and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae , what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild ? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ ( the water flea ) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff ( like fish ) eat the mosquito larvae , the _Daphnia_ , etc. If this organism gets out of control , it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon , I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle , because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels , like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment , which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible .

"My guess is that they have a spectrum analyzer in FM radio band range , and they measure relative signal strengths of different LO frequencies. Knowing that one frequency is , for instance , have 10 time amplitude of the other , you can say that 10 times more radios tuned to a certain station , if traffic is heavy and many cars are within "" detection radius "" of the device. You can also count cars and make certain assumptions about what percentage of cars have radio on , and which percentage has radio with "" leaky "" LO. Here is your numerical answer. I would think that accuracy of such measurements is very poor , but it is probably better then alternatives. The rest is marketing. I am guessing here , but I do not believe that this system can work with anything but heavy traffic. Considering speed of cars and fairly small rf leakage of car radios , you need a fair amount of time to pull rf signal out of the noise ( scan rate on spectrum analyzer , for instance ) , and each individual car will be far enough away before scan is complete to be detectable. So , you need a constant flow of cars , so whole traffic can be treated as large radio transmitter working on many frequencies , with different amplitudes on different frequencies. The results will also be skewed toward people with cheap radios. The guys in expensive luxury cars would have lot less leaky radios , and so they listening habits would count less. Anyway , I dont think that anything miraculous is happening here , or that "" Big Brother "" is listening , but I could be wrong. Mike. Thanks , Mike , this is what I was looking for and I agree.

"My last post was sent incomplete , so here is the conclusion. In "" Shiva "" , the asteroid becomes another saterlite of Earth. The mere fact that the earth has another saterlite would create a disruption , which cant be easily forseen. The moon does create sea tides ; it is impossible to guess what impact the new saterlite , probably called Shiva , would affect the climate , a question the author somehow evades. In "" Hammer of God "" , the spaceship sent to kill the asteriod instead deflects it over Antarctica , to the dismay of penguins. Unfortunately , that does trigger the meltdown of the ice-cap , which would be likely to produce effects worse than those caused by Shiva. Once again , Arthur Clarke jumps the question. ( In another of his books , the Richter 10 , Clarke does bring the earthquake , but after a new civilization is conveniently built somewhere in outer space. ) IMHO , all three are not adequate. The most likely outcome for an asteroid attack on such magnatitude would be like this : 1. All attempts to kill the star fail. 2. The rock hits the land. 3. A giant explosion opens up every seismic fault on the earth , and every volcano on earth explodes simultaneously. 4. Coastal civilization is dead , of volcanoes , earthquakes , super- tsunamis , etc. 5. The smoke from all these volcanoes lower global temperature , somewhat offsetting the thermal energy unleashed by the collision. The winners ? Most likely , some hill tribes in Tibet or Andes , who are less likely to be affected from the collision than any other races on earth. The survival odds of the United States ?

"The other Warren is pretty much right. Copy over the WIN98 directory from the shared CD to some nice spot on your hard drive. Then run the setup from that new directory. Mine takes up about 170 MB and is worth keeping around , but then I have a big drive. You could delete that directory afterwards setup , but you would often be scounging this or that CAB file from the network when you make changes.

I sometimes go change mine so it refers to my online files instead of the CD , but the several locations are often there in a drop down menu or recently used locations. Warren S. Hello , IF you have the room on your hard drive you could copy the CD onto it , then boot from floppy to go. The only problem : you would most likely want the disk space back , and Windows will try to refer to that drive every time you install hardware ( or software requiring support ) .

"Which is more efficient at producing energy from the sun ? Would it make sense to let plants collect the sunrays and then perform chemical processes on the plants to extract the energy ? Z Do you mean like growing trees and burning the wood ? : Sure but it takes a fair bit of effort to get the plant energy into forms readily usable by society , on top of the fact that the best land for growing many plants is often where we want to grow food. But to answer your first question IIRC the efficiency of the best solar cells is now somewhere in the vicinity of a bit over 20 % ( I am sure someone will correct me by posting the latest record or something : ) but I dont know what the equivalent figure is for plants. I imagine it depends on the type of plant and how it is used for energy , e.g. corn turned into ethanol gives one efficiency , trees turned into firewood another , but I really dont know for sure. You also have to figure in the energy required to produce the energy ( manufacturing solar cells versus planting , havesting , processing , etc. for plants ) if you want the total picture. At this time there is some energy produced both ways , so they are technically feasible in some sense , but neither has been cheap enough to gain a large market share.

If the only alternative is screening interrupts caused by changes on four channels ( I am using RB4-7 and edge detection on all four are ctlled by the same bit ) , then your way might be more economical of processor power. ps With the interupt approach , the chips response to interrupts would act as a low pass filter ( no problemo ) - which brings me to my other point. Are there other chips out there , as inexpensive as the PIC series , perhaps even in the PIC series , with the same programming support = popularity ( I built my programmer from plans on the web ) which would allow pull-up/interupt individually on three IO lines ? or perhaps even a peripheral edge detect fcn ?

"Hello Daniel. When I looked at your site the first time , I indeed missed something. Without really looking closelly , I saw your motion picture as push gravity. Never the less , I still have some reservations. The major one is , that you are producing ever bigger gravitons , which themselves do not have any justification for their speed. Should you use the same principle for them as you use for the photon , you would end up with an infinite fractal sequence of particles. No matter how you skin it , the energy of your interaction must come from somwhere. If you take it from the gravitons , your gravitons will loose their speed on every interaction. I would say that your gravitation should be less on a dayside than on your night side. Another point is the redshift of photon. If it were accelerated instantly by the gravitons , there would be no reason for it. I would almost say that the light should have only one frequency , as your gravitons are supplying energy in abundance. I will have to chew on this one , though. One thing seems to be in contradiction with the approach. It looks like an electron recoils when it radiates a photon. That would mean that the instant speed of light is given by the photon dynamics , rather than being result of interaction with gravitation. Mind you , this is orthodox stuff. But I dont think that they are completely wrong on everything. They do deserve a lot of credit. Otherwise , it seems that you followed the same path for your argumentation that I did , which is common sense. That argumentation of yours is better than anything I have seen so far , and logical all right. Regards Slavek .

"Not wanting to be forever purchasing AA batteries to power my Nexstar , I went to Radio Shack to see what I could find. They of course have rechargable AAs , but the fine print on the package says that they only put out 1.2 V fully charged. Remembering others comments that the N5 is fairly sensitive to voltage drop , I decided to avoid those. I ended up buying a 12V sealed rechargable lead-acid battery rated at 4Ah ( RS part # 23-289 ) and a couple of power cords , one that is two clips conected to a cigarette lighter style outlet , and a cigarette jack to 2.1 mm mini plug that fits the N5. The latter also would of course power the N5 directly from the car cigarette lighter jack. The battery cost $ 24.99 , is 2.7 x 3.5 x 4.0 inches , and weighs probably 2.5 or 3 pounds. The two power cords were $ 4.95 each or close to that. I have not yet gotten a charger for the battery. The combination works great , although I have not had it out for an extended period yet , and the power cord at $ 4.95 is a lot cheaper than the Celestron one at $ 19.99 ! Hello , I plan of buying a Nexstar very shortly. I also plan on using 12V 4 , 7 and 15AH batteries to power it. I charge mine ( Currently use them for low power amateur radio ) with a solar panel and charge controller. The 4 and 7 AH batteries charge up in about 5-6 hours.

Yesterday I scanned my negative with the "" ICE "" turned off , I found all photos get one or two straight lines along the direction of film feeding besides the white dots of dust. I checked the film under strong light and believed the film surface has been scarched after passing through the SA-20 strip film feeder. I opened the SA-20 and found the scarch lines matched 2 of the plastic guiding webs at the rear inner compartment. I want to ask : 1 ) Anyone get the same problem ? 2 ) Is it caused by curved film strip ? 3 ) Shall I take the machine to service ? 4 ) How to avoid ? Thanks all ! NO problem with mine - but I dont use it often as it curls the film. First make sure it is the scanner. Check another piece of film from the same roll - one that has not been through the SA-20. If it has the same scratches then it is your lab. If not , look around for a piece of film you dont have any use for , like the strip that proceeds the first shot on the processed roll. The one with the labs number on it. Cut off that part and run it through the scanner - make sure it is NOT scratched before you start. If it comes back out unscratched put it through again.

"Theory of Evolution works as follows : Even Christians acknowlege micro-evolution.the tendancy for creatures to adapt to their environment through changes in the gene pool. They deny MACRO evolution , that is , one species change to the next. Most of this is a failure to understand what macro-evolution is. One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was "" The Theory that man decended from apes. "" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree , not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99 % of their genetic code. Before there were men , or women , or apes , there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years , they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains , and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair , gained inteligence , and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically , macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution , as if it were forbidden by their god or something. Could it be that the christian god is influencing evolution to create creatures in his favor ? Frank Bartunek Actually , a lot of us Christians have no problem with Evolution. sean

"Even so , there were thousands of PPC accelerators sold ( I cant remember how many ) so 200 pre-payments is a pretty poor show. Microcode Solutions could have made much more money by ditching the Amiga and going over to the PC. They must be considering it now given the apparent lack of interest in Amiga FusionPPC and PCxPPC. They have to get their beer money from somewhere ! Thats not an apparent lack of interest. If a software company asked PC users to pay for software which had not yet been written , on a promise that it would be released by a particular date , I doubt they would get many takers. Also , PC users dont face as many vapor products as Amiga users. I think some of us have gotten a little jaded with so many raised hopes and undelivered products. But I am not saying that applies to FusionPPC. The fact is I dont know. The atmosphere of vapor products has trickled all the way to the top of the food chain at AI/Gateway. It makes it very difficult to convince the majority of PPC / Amiga owners ( including me ) to risk the money in this situation. Desperation should not force us to pay for software which we have no way of knowing if it will be any good. I am sure that if FusionPPC is released at a reasonable price , and proves to be a good product , it will sell well. But until it is released , you really cant complain about Amiga users not supporting it. Once Microcode release FusionPPC and proves it is not just another good intention , more Amiga owners will buy. But what will really turn things around is hearing how good it works and all the popular PowerMac software titles that current owners are running. After all , thats why people buy things. People are more apt to purchase an actual working product than a good intention. Especially with the roller coaster ride the remaining Amiga owners have had to endure.joe

How come the heat obviously travels inside this material toward the far end ? Regards Slavek. I thought heat was caused by over-stimulated molecules. Heat is energy. Energy can be released by a variety of things. No molecules , no heat. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat : two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror , travels through a distance to the other mirror , and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the "" heat "" radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic , randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments ( their internal bar magnets ) . Tom Davidson Aurora , CO

"Another aspect I find disturbing is the way this entire chapter reads , digital and analog have their own pitfalls , and one really doesnt sound better than the other. If this were the case , then why are manufacturers constantly trying to make digital sound more analog ? Are they really , or does their ad copy say that because it is number 3 on the list of favorite consumer buzzwords ( right after tube and warm ) ? A great analog deck sounds better than a great digital system. I would say thats a matter of opinion , but thats not the point I wanted to make. In the -middle- of the market , and definately as you move further down the audio food chain , digital usually sounds _better_ than the analog alternatives. Those working with top-of-the-line gear , analog or digital , represent a very small minority of the pro audio demographic. I make my living as a full-time audio practitioner , and even I rarely get to use top drawer systems. The point is that even if one were to declare analog to be ultimately superior in a best-case scenario , it doesnt mean it will be at all points below that.

"20 years ago , there wasnt the market for more than a handful of full time audio practioners , but today anyone with some creative musical talent can be one. The cost of putting music into distributable form ( this is the bottom line of the "" audio practice "" we are talking about ) has become almost negligable , allowing more people to buy into the business and spend as much time as they need to in order to make a living. R.A.P. tends to be kinda "" album-centric "" and I wonder if thats why I sometimes see things a little differently. Most of the work I do has nothing to do with making records. Some of it is recording TV shows , some of it is dialog/voice-over work , some of it is taking music recorded by others and molding it into new shapes and sizes. Some of it is also live , but the analog vs. digital debate is somewhat less significant in those circumstances ( though still not irrelevant ) . I probably _could_ do more record work if I could get over this case of ADAT-in-garage-aphobia. I agree that there is now room for more audio workers than there used to be , but bear in mind that we are not all self-producing album makers. I deal with the same reliability , compatibility and deadline issues as a commercial music studio , but the processes ( and to a certain extent , the objectives ) are different.

( really closer to a 100 to 1 right now IF you believe the government - which I am sure you dont. Who knows maybe the government is stockpiling troops somewhere so they can take over the country ! : ) As for tanks , those guys have to come out of the tanks sometime. The lowly deer rifle is just great at picking off man-sized targets from hundreds of yards away. The gov forces would _never_ be able to consider themselves safe. A dead man is going to be "" picking off "" anyone. there is no point in continuing this. You have an inherent distrust of power that isnt yours. I do not. Go to the mountains , train for when the army will try to take over , and IF you are right I hope the uranium depleted shell that heads your way doesnt get you. The government has approximately 12,000,000 in the armed services. This is a very , very rough guess. In Michigan alone on opening day of deer season there is an estimated 1,000,000 plus hunters out there ready to go. This number does not take into account how many other people have guns personally nor does it take into account how many people are armed in other states. There are iirc 400,000 standing Marines currently enlisted. These Marines are trained to protect the Citizens and the Constitution against all threats both foreign and domestic. Finally there was a survey done about 4 years ago of the armed services in which the military was asked , "" Would they fire upon a US citizen if ordered to "" . 60 % replied they would not and of those 60 % , 85 % said they would actively defend the citizens against those trying to carry out such an order. The 12,000,000 available is now down to 4,800,000 with approximately the same number of their fellow servicemen willing to stop them. These numbers dont include all the retired Marines and other military personel who would fight for the Citizens and not the government. If the government wasnt worried about an armed citizenry then why do they try to take away our guns ?

"Theory of Evolution works as follows : Even Christians acknowlege micro-evolution.the tendancy for creatures to adapt to their environment through changes in the gene pool. They deny MACRO evolution , that is , one species change to the next. Most of this is a failure to understand what macro-evolution is. One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was "" The Theory that man decended from apes. "" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree , not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99 % of their genetic code. Before there were men , or women , or apes , there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years , they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains , and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair , gained inteligence , and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically , macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution , as if it were forbidden by their god or something. Could it be that the christian god is influencing evolution to create creatures in his favor ? it is worse than that. Those Christians of the "" Young-Earth "" variety contradict themselves frequently on micro and macro. They claim macro is impossible , yet to make the ark "" work "" they limit the number of animals to "" kinds "" then promote RAPID mutation rates to change the generic "" bear "" kind into black bears and polar bears and kodiak bears and even kuala bears in less than 6000 years.

"Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. What surprised me is that the team has more depth than last year even with injuries and holdouts. This was only one game , but the roster itself simply looks better than last years to me. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. Steve Kariya did well too , in my opinion. I see why he made the team. Mogilny had some jump himself ! I bet losing ten pounds was only a good thing for him. I remember that Stephane Quintal did this last year and he instantly got more jump on the ice. It is so much easier to skate around when you got ten less pounds to carry. And he was more aggressive. He needs to go straight to the Net sometimes , though , not just wait for the late man to take his pass. He scored more than 50 goals in the past , he should take shots. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do.

As I knew it , privacy is designed to prevent inadvertent human errors by segregating pieces from one another. A compiler doesnt have to respect this. Having a compiler really only be able to see public parts means that no information beyond the language level can be transmitted-what if the compiler , e.g. wanted to have a way to designate whether or not it figured out that certain functions were side-effect free ? Whether they could use some special calling convention ? Concepts which are not necessarily part of the Fortran language itself ?

"Try Dillman Kempo Karate Dave "" When pure knuckles meet pure flesh , thats pure Karate , no matter who executes it or whatever style is involved. "" Ed Parker THIS IS A LONG ONE Well , not necessarily new , but new enough. I am looking to train in a form of martial art. In the past , I had studied for several years in the style of Ishin Ryu karate , but had to withdraw from courses due to a hip injury. This was nearly 6 years ago. I have decided that it would be a good idea to begin studies again , while I am still relatively young. However , I would like to begin anew in another style. The problem is , with hundreds of styles and forms and variations on those , it is hard to decide. So , my first question is , what would be your recommendation. To help you decide , here is some background on myself and what I am looking for : I am near 63 "" in height. I would consider myself medium build ( a little above average , I bench just over 200 and curl just over 100 , so think of someone like that ) and weigh around 200 pounds ( although I tend to deviate , and am currently losing ) . As far as speed and flexibility , I am still above average , even at my weight. Also , I am 19 years old , so all my joints and bones are still in good shape. As far as what I am looking for , there are a couple of factors : 1 ) Usefulness 2 ) Health I want something that is not just for show. If I were to ever be assaulted or something like that , I would want to be able to defend myself. The one problem that I saw with karate is that it was such a hard style that the only way I could really defend myself was by pulverizing the attacker. I would like to have an option to use hard force if I must , but to also defend myself without injuring anyone if at all possible. ( It may seem a little juvenile and impractical , but I would also be interested in training in a weapons style at some point , as I find it very interesting ) It would be nice , also , to train in a style that would improve my overall health.

"Theory of Evolution works as follows : Even Christians acknowlege micro-evolution.the tendancy for creatures to adapt to their environment through changes in the gene pool. They deny MACRO evolution , that is , one species change to the next. Most of this is a failure to understand what macro-evolution is. One Christian gentleman I spoke to thought it was "" The Theory that man decended from apes. "" Not quite. Evolutionary theory says that man and monkey are cousins on the tree , not father-son. The stipulation makes sense because humans and the greater apes share nearly 99 % of their genetic code. Before there were men , or women , or apes , there was something that was sorta monkey like. Some of it is decendants had to stay in the trees and eat fruit to survive. Over millions of years , they became modern apes. Others were forced to go hunting on the plains , and use tools and fire. These lost their body hair , gained inteligence , and grew eventually into mankind. This did not happen overnight. Any casual observer would be long dead before any noticable changes happened. Basically , macro evolution is repeated separated micro-evolution until the two groups of creatures can no longer interbreed. Scientists call this Speciation. The last thing I have wondered is why Christians refuse to accept evolution , as if it were forbidden by their god or something. Could it be that the christian god is influencing evolution to create creatures in his favor ? Frank Bartunek

I remember this witticism from a college class on the old testament.

"Generally I agreebut I am not sold on Weekes. He went down every time the puck was nearby. Richard Brodeur had some success with that style , but then he had an awesome glove hand to compensate. I havent seen a goalie make so many routine saves look spectacular since Mike Palmateer , and the broadcasters were fooled by him as well. Wait until word gets out to shoot often , and highwhich should be by the next game , if he starts. I hope he proves me wrong. john Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. What surprised me is that the team has more depth than last year even with injuries and holdouts. This was only one game , but the roster itself simply looks better than last years to me. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. Steve Kariya did well too , in my opinion. I see why he made the team. Mogilny had some jump himself ! I bet losing ten pounds was only a good thing for him. I remember that Stephane Quintal did this last year and he instantly got more jump on the ice. It is so much easier to skate around when you got ten less pounds to carry. And he was more aggressive. He needs to go straight to the Net sometimes , though , not just wait for the late man to take his pass. He scored more than 50 goals in the past , he should take shots. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do. That center line seems better to me with Messier , Cassels ( happy to see this guy , I like him ) and Bertuzzi. It is the first time we seem to have some depth in. years and years. Sorry for the long rant , but this was my first change to see what happens with them. you dont get a lot of games when you live in Montreal : ) Cross yer fingers and pray for the season to continue in a good way : ) Michael ( positive for now )

"I was thinking about this over the weekend. I was/am an NT developer. However , I am currently working on an OSS based project , FreeBSD and Linux , in doing so , my existence is ( for the time being ) 100 % Microsoft free. I feel liberated. I somehow feel that better all around. I am forced to wonder. When I was doing NT exclusively , I had been working in a Windows environment for some time. I originated in UNIX , started doing DOS stuff , then Windows , then NT. I found that Windows and NT was all I was used to. I resisted going back to UNIX. I didnt want to because "" Windows NT "" was the future. I rationalized why NT was better , I could argue with the best UNIX guys. Exactly. Back in high school I used those old NeXT boxes and I loved it. In college I was required to do most of my CS homework under UNIX and so I installed Linux 1.0 ( 1994 ? I cant remember anymore ) to work with it. My home machine was a dual 95/Linux box. NT came out in a big way , and my first job ( Lockheed Martin ) had just migrated from OS/2 to NT4. I started playing with it and loved it. There were some quarks with the system , but according to every meter there was it was the new thing. When I was offered a better job , where I had control of the projects , I accepted. The place was a big on AIX and I started migrating stuff over to NT. It was then that I realized how convenient many things were under UNIX ( simple things like cross-platform backup authentication ) . Linux was installed on the main fileserver and it worked beautifully ; the NT server was a pain for many things ranging from user creation to mailing lists. Remote-administrating it was ( is ) a joke without spending a lot more money. System administratorion is just a side-job here , so I dont want to deal with it as much as possible. I still use NT , but mostly on the client where it acts as a stable version of Windows 95 and not on the server where you must all but commit to 100 % Microsoft solutions. I just ordered Oracle8 for Linux , and we will be migrating the 36GB databse over to Linux ; thatll leave me with one NT server left ( an IIS/frontpage server ) . I even have a few Linux clients out there for some users who need it is capabilities. The wheel is turning but the hamster is dead .

"Luc , while I know your new to these groups you should be careful about making wide claims. You said : Therefore the only way for the authors of these theories to convince the physics community would be to do some calculations which were never done before. Patently untrue. I will give you two ( but not the total derivative basis in this post , MKSC units are used herein ) . First , in the material medium model elemental charge ( e ) can be defined as Div p , where p is the momentum potential at any point in the medium ( this give it units of kg/sec ) . Now , if charge has units of kg/sec , the charge to mass ( m ) ratio ( e/m ) has resulting units of frequency. So Luc , what IS the black body temperature equal to e/m for the lowly electron ( care to take a guess ? ) . Second , with units of kg/sec we can now devine heretofore unknown relationships , like the basis for the thermal-electric coupling. A.k.a. Boltzmanns constant k is : h k = - = 1.38E-23 m-sec ^ 2 ec Yielding units of kg-m/sec ^ 3 for Kelvins ( commonly called impact ) . If you think about that , it makes perfect sense. And there are of course , several more. Because they can not do this , mainstream science is not interested and Aether theories stays on the dead branch of science on which they have been for one century. Well .

My question is this : where does this leave me in a conflict with a grappler ? Without empasis on at least counter grappling , this will leave yo uout of your element. The UFC is actually a god example here. The people who had never before delte with a skilled grapple found they cold not drop them fast enough to aviod a clench.

The practice of Islam in Indonesia is certainly much different from it is practice in other geographic areas. Our specific association is Christian in nature , and that of only a particular coloration ; joyful in it is expression. We also dont seek out certain occupations to become affiliated- it is sufficient that a man choose a certain occupation to indicate that many of his other life decisions would be at odds with what we practice.

The operative words are "" small "" , "" routine "" and "" excerpt. "" You need to isolate the smallest possible example that exhibits the problem. Then it will be a lot easier to get help. Usually , when I have a problem such as yours , and I isolate the example as described , by the time I get a small example that works , I understand the problem. it is nearly always some problem in my code. The fact that some compilers accept it anyway is irrelevant. OTOH , if the compiler is really at fault , the small excerpt will make that obvious. I support a large code that has been ported to just about every commercial UNIX. Despite every attempt to write portable code , there are bugs in the code that turn up with every port. There are occasionally compiler bugs that turn up too , and one time there was even a problem that have turned up where the F90 standard was not completely clear , and the compiler implementer interpreted it one way and I interpreted it another way. ( They ended up agreeing with me on that one , BTW. : ) But in many cases , understanding could not have been achieved working on the whole code.

"how do you get electrons out of atoms ? You shove them out hard enough to get them out of the potential well of the nucleus ( as modified by any other electrons present ) . ie how do you ionise atoms ? You can shake them real hard , or you can bang something ( e.g. another electron or something more exotic , a photon or two , etc. ) into the atom ; and generally you knock some electrons loose. Einstein mentioned something about this latter method. You can also pull them off with an electrostatic field. here is a clue "" you put energy in "" I just said that. why is no-one suspicious of generating their own electrons ? Are you implying I have to put the rest-mass equivalent of an electron ( .511 MeV ) into a cathode to get an electron out ? I know better. Of course , you can generate electrons without ionizing anything , but you get a positron too. But you need twice .511 MeV for that trick. what is the proof that the atom is truly ionised ? Because it then tries to pull electrons from nearby matter , and you can measure that pull. how long does it take one freshly ionised atom to recover in a homogeneous medium , lets say ? Depends how much the atoms in the medium want to hold on to their electrons , how badly the ion wants them ( or vice versa ) , how freely the medium in question passes electrons , and so on. aka what happens when you switch off the electricity to a cathode ray tube ? You begin a process that eventually ends as : you no longer get electrons hitting the TV screen. Two separate causes working together. 1. ) The cathode eventually gets too cold ( stops shaking hard enough ) to push electrons out into the interelectrode spaces , and 2. ) There are no electrostatic fields present to push the electrons all the way to the screen. As the cathode cools , the spot gets dimmer ( fewer electrons ) . As the electrode voltages decay ( through whatever external resistances are attached ) the beam spot may get smaller , larger , wander over the screen , etc. So , whats your point ? Mark L.

The 4047 is thick and mellow where the 4050 is thin and crispy. You can use a 4050 on almost anything and get at least a halfway decent sound. I dont think I could say the same thing about the 4047. Thatd sit better with me if the 4033 didnt exist- I would agree with the 4047 characterization , but put the 4033 as thin and crispy ( or bright and clear , depending on where you are coming from ) , and stick the 4050 in the middle as fairly neutral. One of the interesting things about the 4047 is that it has two very deep nulls around 200 Hz or so , 120 degrees off the center axis.

If you have sublists then one possibility is to convert the pointers in your list into locations in the file. Generally this means working out where each item will be stored before actually storing any of them. Youll also need a special value for writing out the null pointer , I always use 0 and write a small header at the beginning of the file so that 0 can not be a valid location for a data item.

"Just saw a posting on Suns web page and saw Staroffice for sale for 6.95. Actually the cd comes with three or four ports of the program. Is this collection of things worth getting for OS2 ? I seem to remember reading in the Linux groups that Staroffice ran slowly. Might be wrong though. I have StarOffice v5.1 installed on two machines here and conclude that StarOffice loves memory. there is no such thing as too much memory for StarOffice. On my OS/2 machine ( 5x86/133 32MB ) it takes about a minute to load and although slow at times it is usable. On my linux machine ( PII-350 128MB ) it takes about 7 seconds to load and is nice and snappy. So now I usually just use it on the linux machine , sometimes from the OS/2 box using XFree86 to connect to the linux box. SO is none too swift on a 412.5 MHZ oclocked AMD-K62 with 256 MB of RAM , 1 MB of L2 , multiple fast SCSI UWs. But once in RAM one forgets about that most of the time. It IS virtually ( perhaps totally ? ) immune to Word macro viruses I have been given from time to time by clients. On that score , it is welcome to an Athlon and 1 GB of RAM if it needs it.

"Yes she did. We would have ended up losing the proverbial shirt. That is why we left the total lines proofed and the amount of proofreading time it took to make them client ready on our end for folks to see. With proof reading logs in hand and the orginial contract they signed assuring us of 98.5 % accuracy the Big K , uhmmmm , negotiated a very different price for the work returned which was substandard. Needless to say they were not happy and simply could not understand why we were not happy with the quality of the work. With the amount of money being poured into training for offshore MTs I have no doubt that eventually that quality is going to improve , but the basic problems will still remain the same. After all , if Healthscribe , who has probably been at this longer than any of them , are still subjecting their offshore MTs to extensive proofing it should be pretty evident that there are some things those "" ears "" just are never gon na pick up on. And , last I heard , their offshore division has yet to turn a significant profit. Personally I do not understand why these companies cant grasp the concept that those same dollars invested here would more likely have a much better return for MTs who do not require extensive proof reading and editing. But what I personally think is not really an issue here. The fact is that this is happening right now and will continue to happen. Nothing we do now will stop it. All we can do is share our experience so that anyone thinking of utilizing an offshore service has a better understanding of the problems and pitfalls involved. Can ask more informed questions , negotiate a better contract , and hopefully not end up on the short end of the stick. Nae Nae did you do any calculations on what it cost to basically redo the work ? I have yet to hear that any of the companies investing in offshore transcription have made any money. I would be interested in knowing if they have studied the long-term return on offshore v. US training , notwithstanding the tendency of Americans to whine and be overly demanding.

Can it have something to do with ambient temperatures along the length of the rod , the surface skin of the rod interfering with heat transfer ( flux or corrosion coated , or the change in molecular density resulting from the extrusion process in creation of the rod ) , atoms in close proximately to the heat source ( grinding wheel and rod tip ) deflecting any further disruption of their worlds to someplace a little less disturbed ( distant cooler portions of rod ) , less surface area for dissipation of heat at the tip in your palm or could you have particularily sensitive palms ? Do gloves help ? Dave Nelson Hello David. I have to poke into this. When you sharpen a tip on a 6 "" long tungsten welding electrode , which may be anywhere between 1/16 "" and 1/8 "" thick , and the other already sharpened end is in your palm , the tip in your palm burns you before the bulk much closer to the sharpened point does. How come the heat obviously travels inside this material toward the far end ? Regards Slavek. I thought heat was caused by over-stimulated molecules. Heat is energy. Energy can be released by a variety of things. No molecules , no heat. There is a classic demonstration concerning heat : two magnifying mirrors are arranged so that light from the focus of one mirror bounces off the mirror , travels through a distance to the other mirror , and is refocussed at the focal point of the second mirror. This arrangement is called a Schlieren system , and has many uses. A pane of glass is placed in the middle to prevent movement of molecules from one mirror to the other. An unlit latch is placed at the focus of one mirror , and a second match is lit at the focus of the other mirror. The unlit match can be ignited by the "" heat "" radiation that is gathered by one mirror , passed through the glass , and refocussed by the second mirror. Doesnt heat also disrupt magnetic flux ? Not directly. It can disturb atoms or molecules that are ferromagnetic , randomizing the orientations of their permanent magnetic moments ( their internal bar magnets ) . Tom Davidson Aurora , CO

"I am talking about chemicals that NO ONE has ever eaten. My body has an evolutionary history & can handle anything that humans & most of their ancestors ate in the past , but not some chemicals that never existed before. But thats _why_ you should support genetically modified food crops. When a chemist creates a new synthetic insecticide , _thats_ a chemical your body has never seen before. When a biologist splices a gene from a flounder into a tomato plant ( which has been done to improve frost resistance ) , that is just rearranging existing natural chemicals. What concerned me about re-engineeering a species of blue-green algae is the possibilty it could escape and begin reproducing on its own. Once released , there is no way we could call it back. Worse , this particular example of re-engineered algae has a potent insecticide in it , which could upset the ecosystem at a very fundamental level .

"We also have the problem of defining "" economist "" the problem I was suggesting when I pointed out that there were creationists who , in terms of academic credentials , qualified as biologists. It doesnt follow that there is serious controversy within biology over creation vs evolution. There are lots of people who would describe themselves as economists who I wouldnt describe as real economists , and who I suspect Paul Krugman , whose politics are rather different from mine , wouldnt describe as real economists either. The reason is not that they disagree with meEarl Thompson and Abba Lerner disagreed with me , and certainly were ( in Earls case , still is ) economists. The reason is that they either could not get a reasonably good grade on a price theory exami.e. do not understand the fundamentals of economic theoryor could get it only by giving answers they didnt believei.e. dont agree with the fundamentals of economic theory.

OS20MEMU works fine here with Warp 4 FP11. Michael OS20MEMU is not gon na work on Warp 3 beyond FP 17. Period. It was well documented by IBM at the time and was the final straw that drove me to Warp 4. ( Note that this is probably over 2 years by now. ) Following is my experience. YMMV. If so I would like to know. Whether OS20MEMU works on Warp 4 is not dependant on FP level ; it is dependant on how much RAM youve got. I am at FP9. Up until a month ago I had a 486DX2 with 24M on a Zeos Gosling MB. OS20MEMU worked flawlessly. I swapped out the old MB for a Soyo 5EHM K6-III 400 with 128M. OS20MEMU stopped functioning. Unlike the Warp 3 case where it displayed error an message that it was not gon na work , in this case it simply fails to produce any useful output. I dont think this is true. What I found was that one of the IBM1S506.ADD releases ( and those do come in the fixpacks , too ) broke OS20MEMU ! To get it working again , use , for example , the DANIS506.ADD replacement , or get an SCSI system : , or use an older IBM1S506.ADD if you only have smaller IDE drives , so that you dont need the fixes in the newer releases of that driver. I think the problem is the zombie DOS VDM that is started by the newer IBM1S506.ADD drivers at initialisation , but can not prove this. I once had a very short newsgroup conversation with Sam Detweiler about this , must have been 1997 or so , when the problem started even with Warp 4 ?

"Marcel , Thanks for posting this. Just one small comment to those who made the original pledge : ( And anyone else who is interested in FusionPPC. ) I know that the Blittersoft request to make good on your pledge came at a bad time for the Amiga in general , and it is not an easy decision. I went ahead with my order for a few reasons : 1 ) I made a promise , and I expect a good product in return. I think that Jim has gone beyond the call of duty to pledge that Fusion PPC will be completed ( by Nov 20 ) , despite falling short of the pre-order goal. 2 ) I havent even bought a PPC board yet ( I have been waiting for Fusion PPC ) to put it to good use. If you are thinking of jumping ship to the Mac , you may as well get FusionPPC , and still be able to hold on to your Amiga dreams. 3 ) There is still hope for the Amiga , esp. PPC/QNX based systems. Perhaps this hope is even better now that Gateway is offically out of the picture. This is a message from Paul Lesurf of Blittersort posted to the Fusion Mailing List ; . If you did pledge your suppport to pre-pay Fusion PPC and have not done so , please reconsider and do so now. Best wishes , Paul Lesurf Blittersoft Rhett R.

"quoting me , kts : The Genesis account is full of patterns look at the parallel between days 1-3 and days 4-6 intended to get across , not literal details , but the idea that the creation was orderly. Correctly : There were ( no less than ) four authors of Genesis ; you read too much into their respective overlapping. you are confusing the seven-day creation with other places in Genesis where stories are repeated from different sources. The seven-day story is not repeated ; actually , it is contradicted by the Garden of Eden story which follows in chapter 2. The seven-day story is an obviously carefully crafted , unified piece of poetry. The parallel I mentioned is : 1 : Light separated from darkness 4 : Lights ( stars ) in the sky 2 : seas separated from heavens 5 : fish and birds 3 : earth separated from seas 6 : land animals and then plants and then humans Note the order-out-of-chaos theme.

"I am the poor unfortunate wretch who started this thread a few days ago. I would like to comment on the responses it has generated so far. Conover , Oct. 14 : I sit corrected. I should have said that the slope was everywhere positive , rather than saying that the function was monotonic. Will everyone please drop the argument about monotonicity ? it is irrelevant. Yes , I know that the impedance function is entirely represented by its zeros and poles. Oddly enough , no one has mentioned that the zeros and poles are interlaced along the real omega axis. Or that the impedance function is always odd in omega. Thats true , isnt it , Harry ? Green , Oct. 14 : I am talking about purely reactive networks. So there is no energy absorption. Nothing has been said about maxima , because there are no maxima. Herring , Oct. 14 : You say that reactance is zero at resonance. Thats true for a series resonant LC circuit. A parallel resonant LC circuit has infinite reactance at resonance. I am not interested in circuits containing 2 elements. I am interested in circuits of arbitrary complexity containing only pure reactances. Meron , Oct. 14 : Yes , tan ( x ) is an example of a function that has positive slope everywhere. It passes through infinity every once in a while , and is a simple example of the kind of function I am talking about. Conover , Oct. 15 : Right on. Your disdain is admirable. Houghton , Oct. 15 : Phase is of very little interest in situations where the functions are pure imaginary , as they are when there is no resistance. The phase is either 90 or 270 degrees , nothing else. ( Well , OK , it is indeterminate when the resistance and reactance are both zero. ) Meron , Oct. 15 : You are right again , but you are getting off the subject , which was Fosters Theorem .

There is ( so far ) a lot more sample code , helpful web sites , programmer utilities , and other useful goodies available for C than C + + , though the gap is closing. Any C + + programmer can help you with C. Many C programmers can not help you with C + + ( unless they are also C + + programmers ) . C + + is a much larger language than C. Almost everything you learn about C is applicable to C + + , but only a small part of C + + is relevant to C. Because C is a much smaller language , it takes much less time to learn. C + + has largely replaced C in general-purpose programming , and jobwise , you almost have to learn C + + eventually. So consider these things and use your best judgment.
