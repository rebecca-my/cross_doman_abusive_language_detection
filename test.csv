"here is my five cents : 1 ) Linux is free , as are all of its applications. if you want to learn c , you can customize it to your hearts content. the only thing you pay for in Linux is the nice packaging and support. it is entirely legal to copy someone elses disk. you can run a program called star office , which is an MS clone , and is compatible with MS office documents. also free. nt and win2k are freaking expensive , the full version of ntw4 is at least 200 bucks ( Canadian ) . 2 ) the driver support for Linux is not complete. of course it is also not complete for nt or win2k , but is better for nt at least. check the hardware compatibility lists for each os and your hardware. win98 probably has the best hardware compatibility , although nt isnt bad if you dont want to worry about having certified drivers. 3 ) the application support is best on win98 , as it will play the most games , and 16 bit apps. most games will not play on nt , or if they do , will play much better on 98 due to better directx support. 4 ) win98 crashes like a Hungarian bus on the Italian alps in February. nt is very stable if you have certified hardware and drivers , and dont fuck around with it regularly like I do. I have heard Linux is incredibly stable. read an article about a guy that has run it for over 2 years without a stall. 5 ) win98 sets up like a pair of silk panties. very smooth. nt isnt bad either , but takes a bit of tweaking. I had to manually install my sound and video drivers , and the plug n play service. I heard BeOS has the best set-up program. 6 ) personally , I have a dual boot system , with win98 for games , nt for real work. since I am not in a mission critical enterprise , I will probably upgrade to win2k as soon as the final release comes out. I say this because of that old rule if it aunt broke dont fix it , and upgrading to win2k from an operating nt4 system would be foolhardy in a mission critical enterprise. unless the risks of a more user friendly os outweigh the risks of using a new , less-extensively tested one .

First of all , how many people can you fit into one doorway ? If a room has ten people and one door , it is going to be a bit of a struggle to get that prime doorway position , isnt it ? Secondly , a doorway is just a hole. I realise that doorways have lots of bracing around them , but once the building collapses , I dont think the doorway is going to be left standing. Now as I said , I havent been in any big earthquakes ( I think the largest was a number 4 ) . Can somebody who has been in a big earthquake where buildings collapse tell me : Do the doorways magically remain standing with people sheltering in them when the building collapses ? Or is the "" shelter in the doorway "" advice JUST A LITTLE BIT SILLY ? I read recently somewhere that the business abotu standing in a doorway is obsolete avice. Modern wood-frame buildings are not especially stronger in doors than eslewhere , and in a doorway the door could whap you a lot. If the building collapses you are in trouble anyway.

Has anybody tried this ? It would probably not work. The best thing to do is push yourself down onto the floor so you are lying down. However , the whole point of the Otis elevator safety brakes was that if the cable snaps , that causes the brakes to activate. So elevators plummet only in murder mysteries and action-adventure movies. There was an article about that in Scientific American within the past year.

"Up till now , I hadnt heard about any GM products that concerned me about their safety. A few transplanted genes arent going make a tomato feel pain or let you squeeze blood from a turnip. The worst scenario that seemed reasonable to me is that some agricultural product , like cotton , would turn into an insect-resistant , herbicide-resistant , uncontrollable weed. Sort of like accidentally inventing a new Kudzu vine. But I have recently learned about a new GMO that sounds really scary to me. It seems to me like the sort of GMO youd make if you were trying to destroy the environment. This is _Synechococcus_ blue-green algae modified with the addition of the Bt toxin from bacteria. You can read about Cyanotechs plan is to sell dried blue-green algae containing this toxin. The idea is that mosquito larvae eat algae , so treat bodies of water harboring mosquitoes with this algae , and the mosquitoes will be killed. Although the business model appears to be to sell killed algae , what happens if even one living cell of this algae escapes into the wild ? it is not just mosquito larvae that eat algae. _Daphnia_ ( the water flea ) feeds on it. Lots of stuff feeds on it. And other stuff ( like fish ) eat the mosquito larvae , the _Daphnia_ , etc. If this organism gets out of control , it could be devastating to the ecological web. If I were trying to design an anti- ecology weapon , I would choose blue-green algae as the vehicle , because it grows like crazy and can grow in almost any environment where life is found. And I would put something in it that hits the ecological web at its lowest levels , like the stuff that fish eat. I think the development of this product is very dangerous. No other GMO I have heard about has caused me a bit of concern I am very pro-GM. GM can replace synthetic chemical insecticides and improve product quality thats good. But this toxic algae could be like a germ warfare experiment , which we cant call back once it escapes. I think the development of this product is very irresponsible. I have never heard of it , but I conjecture you have gone off half-cocked. Lets see what assurances the Department of Agriculture , the EPA , and the FDA demand.

"Hello Daniel. When I looked at your site the first time , I indeed missed something. Without really looking closelly , I saw your motion picture as push gravity. Never the less , I still have some reservations. The major one is , that you are producing ever bigger gravitons , which themselves do not have any justification for their speed. Should you use the same principle for them as you use for the photon , you would end up with an infinite fractal sequence of particles. No matter how you skin it , the energy of your interaction must come from somwhere. If you take it from the gravitons , your gravitons will loose their speed on every interaction. I would say that your gravitation should be less on a dayside than on your night side. Another point is the redshift of photon. If it were accelerated instantly by the gravitons , there would be no reason for it. I would almost say that the light should have only one frequency , as your gravitons are supplying energy in abundance. I will have to chew on this one , though. One thing seems to be in contradiction with the approach. It looks like an electron recoils when it radiates a photon. That would mean that the instant speed of light is given by the photon dynamics , rather than being result of interaction with gravitation. Mind you , this is orthodox stuff. But I dont think that they are completely wrong on everything. They do deserve a lot of credit. Otherwise , it seems that you followed the same path for your argumentation that I did , which is common sense. That argumentation of yours is better than anything I have seen so far , and logical all right. Regards Slavek .

If the only alternative is screening interrupts caused by changes on four channels ( I am using RB4-7 and edge detection on all four are ctlled by the same bit ) , then your way might be more economical of processor power. ps With the interupt approach , the chips response to interrupts would act as a low pass filter ( no problemo ) - which brings me to my other point.

"To make a cheap isolation transformer , I have often seen the suggestion to take two identical power transformers , connect their secondaries together , and use ones primary as the input and the others as the output.

To help you decide , here is some background on myself and what I am looking for : I am near 63 "" in height. I would consider myself medium build ( a little above average , I bench just over 200 and curl just over 100 , so think of someone like that ) and weigh around 200 pounds ( although I tend to deviate , and am currently losing ) . As far as speed and flexibility , I am still above average , even at my weight. Also , I am 19 years old , so all my joints and bones are still in good shape. As far as what I am looking for , there are a couple of factors : 1 ) Usefulness 2 ) Health I want something that is not just for show. If I were to ever be assaulted or something like that , I would want to be able to defend myself. The one problem that I saw with karate is that it was such a hard style that the only way I could really defend myself was by pulverizing the attacker. I would like to have an option to use hard force if I must , but to also defend myself without injuring anyone if at all possible. ( It may seem a little juvenile and impractical , but I would also be interested in training in a weapons style at some point , as I find it very interesting ) It would be nice , also , to train in a style that would improve my overall health.

The cost of putting music into distributable form ( this is the bottom line of the "" audio practice "" we are talking about ) has become almost negligable , allowing more people to buy into the business and spend as much time as they need to in order to make a living. R.A.P. tends to be kinda "" album-centric "" and I wonder if thats why I sometimes see things a little differently. Most of the work I do has nothing to do with making records. Some of it is recording TV shows , some of it is dialog/voice-over work , some of it is taking music recorded by others and molding it into new shapes and sizes. Some of it is also live , but the analog vs. digital debate is somewhat less significant in those circumstances ( though still not irrelevant ) . I probably _could_ do more record work if I could get over this case of ADAT-in-garage-aphobia. I agree that there is now room for more audio workers than there used to be , but bear in mind that we are not all self-producing album makers.

"Generally I agreebut I am not sold on Weekes. He went down every time the puck was nearby. Richard Brodeur had some success with that style , but then he had an awesome glove hand to compensate. I havent seen a goalie make so many routine saves look spectacular since Mike Palmateer , and the broadcasters were fooled by him as well. Wait until word gets out to shoot often , and highwhich should be by the next game , if he starts. I hope he proves me wrong. john Ok , this game was a good one , despite the holdouts and injuries. Kevin Weekes played well. Maybe not as well as the shouting commentators described it , but he made the saves. If we can have two skilled goaltenders doing the job this year , I think we might be in business. What surprised me is that the team has more depth than last year even with injuries and holdouts. This was only one game , but the roster itself simply looks better than last years to me. I thought that defense was patchwork and that it would fail , but I liked what I saw in Hawgood , Joseph and Bodger. They are no superstars , but they seem to have done their job tonight. Maybe it is just me , but it might hold until guys like Aucoin and Ohlund come back. What they did well was clearing the puck out of the zone. the mistakes were not as numerous as last year. Steve Kariya did well too , in my opinion. I see why he made the team. Mogilny had some jump himself ! I bet losing ten pounds was only a good thing for him. I remember that Stephane Quintal did this last year and he instantly got more jump on the ice. It is so much easier to skate around when you got ten less pounds to carry. And he was more aggressive. He needs to go straight to the Net sometimes , though , not just wait for the late man to take his pass. He scored more than 50 goals in the past , he should take shots. What about those last five minutes ? They kept the Rangers OUT OF THE ZONE , which was what I doubted they could ever do. That center line seems better to me with Messier , Cassels ( happy to see this guy , I like him ) and Bertuzzi. It is the first time we seem to have some depth in. years and years.

"Yes she did. We would have ended up losing the proverbial shirt. That is why we left the total lines proofed and the amount of proofreading time it took to make them client ready on our end for folks to see. With proof reading logs in hand and the orginial contract they signed assuring us of 98.5 % accuracy the Big K , uhmmmm , negotiated a very different price for the work returned which was substandard. Needless to say they were not happy and simply could not understand why we were not happy with the quality of the work. With the amount of money being poured into training for offshore MTs I have no doubt that eventually that quality is going to improve , but the basic problems will still remain the same. After all , if Healthscribe , who has probably been at this longer than any of them , are still subjecting their offshore MTs to extensive proofing it should be pretty evident that there are some things those "" ears "" just are never gon na pick up on. And , last I heard , their offshore division has yet to turn a significant profit. Personally I do not understand why these companies cant grasp the concept that those same dollars invested here would more likely have a much better return for MTs who do not require extensive proof reading and editing. But what I personally think is not really an issue here. The fact is that this is happening right now and will continue to happen. Nothing we do now will stop it. All we can do is share our experience so that anyone thinking of utilizing an offshore service has a better understanding of the problems and pitfalls involved. Can ask more informed questions , negotiate a better contract , and hopefully not end up on the short end of the stick. Nae Nae did you do any calculations on what it cost to basically redo the work ? I have yet to hear that any of the companies investing in offshore transcription have made any money.

Explain to the man. He has a first impression that often hit is someone when looking in on the open source community. Anyway Dave : RedHat and these other corps that create linux distros make money off packaging a conveniently shrink wrapped linux version for you with quick start guides etc and they also offer you tech support as a part of the purchase agreement. OTOH , if you buy a $ 2 CD , then you only have a CD and you are on your own. No-one is obligated to help you with anything. An enterprise will not use an operating system where there isnt a source of reliable and competent tech support. RedHat is one of the suppliers of this tech support for a fee. What do they do with the money for these tech support charges ? Well they put food on the table and also employ developers to enhance their distro to make it even more appealing to the public/enterprises who are interested in deploying linux. This is the source of fuel for the development of , for example , KDE and Gnome. So , in the end , their current customers are happy with the enhancements , they attract new customers and the whole OSS community benefits from these enhancements. Apply these principles to other OSS and this is how money can be made off OSS. Am I right void ? Or do you have anything to add ? = Ali M. = -

"My last post was sent incomplete , so here is the conclusion. In "" Shiva "" , the asteroid becomes another saterlite of Earth. The mere fact that the earth has another saterlite would create a disruption , which cant be easily forseen. The moon does create sea tides ; it is impossible to guess what impact the new saterlite , probably called Shiva , would affect the climate , a question the author somehow evades. In "" Hammer of God "" , the spaceship sent to kill the asteriod instead deflects it over Antarctica , to the dismay of penguins. Unfortunately , that does trigger the meltdown of the ice-cap , which would be likely to produce effects worse than those caused by Shiva. Once again , Arthur Clarke jumps the question. ( In another of his books , the Richter 10 , Clarke does bring the earthquake , but after a new civilization is conveniently built somewhere in outer space. ) IMHO , all three are not adequate. The most likely outcome for an asteroid attack on such magnatitude would be like this : 1. All attempts to kill the star fail. 2. The rock hits the land. 3. A giant explosion opens up every seismic fault on the earth , and every volcano on earth explodes simultaneously. 4.
